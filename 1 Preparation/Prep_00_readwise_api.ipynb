I am a naturally curious person with dozens, if not hundreds of different subjects I’d like to know more about.

The word “resources” calls to mind the utility of a piece of information. Instead of asking, “Is this interesting?” which always results in overcollecting, I ask myself, “Is this useful?” That’s a much higher bar and forces me to consider what this piece of information will allow me to do',\n",

This may be a strange thing to say in a book about organizing, but organizing by itself doesn’t add value. It has no inherent worth unless it puts you in a state of mind for taking effective action. This is why PARA is a minimalistic approach—it opts for little “nudges” to move items from one place to another as your needs change. It is a “bottom-up” method, responding to changes in your life organically. Instead of spending a lot of effort organizing your digital information “just in case” you need it someday, wait until your needs become crystal clear and then organize your notes and files “just in time” for the project you’re working on right now. This is how you avoid doing a lot of up-front work of questionable value, saving your energy for the moment when you know exactly what you’re trying to accomplish.',\n",

Everything else is not only allowed to remain somewhat messy; that’s how it should be. Highly precise systems require a lot of effort to maintain, which means most aspects of your digital world should remain loose and informal by default. This rule recognizes that imposing order on information doesn’t always make it more valuable. You heard that right: sometimes organizing information too much makes it less valuable. The greatest breakthroughs often come from unexpected connections between ideas, and if your system is too rigidly formal, you’ll prevent such connections from ever forming. Allowing some messiness and randomness into the system creates opportunities for very different ideas to be connected and intermixed. This is why I don’t agree with a lot of the recommendations made by organizing gurus. For example, I don’t recommend: •\\xa0\\xa0Creating an internal structure inside folders •\\xa0\\xa0Using a standardized template for the contents of notes or documents •\\xa0\\xa0Creating a hierarchy of subfolders within subfolders many levels deep •\\xa0\\xa0Using databases or other formal methods for organizing personal information I’ve tried all these practices in the past, but always found that they took up valuable time that was much better suited to engaging with the ideas themselves.',\n",

But occasionally, such as during a weekly review, it’s wise to elevate your perspective and think about the long term. This is when the content you’ve collected in your areas of responsibility and resources becomes valuable. At these times of deeper reflection, ask yourself these questions: •\\xa0\\xa0What is the standard (of quality or performance) I’m committed to in each of my areas of responsibility? •\\xa0\\xa0Am I currently meeting that standard? •\\xa0\\xa0If not, are there any new projects, habits, routines, or other practices I can start, stop, or change? •\\xa0\\xa0Are there any resources that would enable me to do so? When evaluating your resources, ask yourself questions like: •\\xa0\\xa0Are there any new interests or passions I’d like to pursue more seriously? •\\xa0\\xa0Are there any curiosities or questions I’d like to start exploring? •\\xa0\\xa0Are there any hobbies or pursuits I’ve allowed to stagnate that I’d like to reboot?',\n",

Human beings don’t merely make individual contributions to a project, like machines operating in an assembly line. Rather, we are able to work together, aware of others and what they are trying to accomplish. We pay attention together and we share goals. In the language of cognitive science, we share intentionality. This is a form of collaboration that you don’t see in other animals. We actually enjoy sharing our mind space with others. In one form, it’s called playing. Our skulls may delimit the frontier of our brains, but they do not delimit the frontier of our knowledge. The mind stretches beyond the brain to include the body, the environment, and people other than oneself, so the study of the mind cannot be reduced to the study of the brain. Cognitive science is not the same as neuroscience.',\n",

       "    'text': 'What is true of face perception is true of all perception. Being smart is all about having the ability to extract deeper, more abstract information from the flood of data that comes into our senses. Instead of just reacting to the light, sounds, and smells that surround them, animals with sophisticated large brains respond to deep, abstract properties of the world that they are sensing. This allows them to detect extraordinarily subtle and complex similarities and differences in new situations that allow them to act effectively, even in situations they’ve never encountered before. The reason that deeper, more abstract information is helpful is that it can be used to pick out what we’re interested in from an incredibly complex array of possibilities, regardless of how the focus of our interest presents itself. We make use of abstract information to, for example, recognize familiar melodies. Once you’ve heard Brahms’s Lullaby, you can recognize it no matter what key it’s played in or what instrument it’s played on, even if it’s played with several errors. Whatever it is that allows us to recognize a familiar tune, it is not a memory of the specific event of hearing that tune in the past. It must be something quite abstract. We rely on this abstract information to recognize stuff all the time, and we’re not even aware that we’re doing so.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Namely, the mind evolved to support our ability to act effectively. Thinking beings were more likely to survive than their competitors because they were more likely to take actions that benefited them in the short run and the long run. This has important implications for how we should understand the shape of thought. As brains get more complex, they get better at responding to deeper, more abstract cues from the environment, and this makes them ever more adaptive to new situations. This is critical to understanding the knowledge illusion: Storing details is often unnecessary to act effectively; a broad picture is generally all we need. Sometimes storing details is counterproductive, as in the case of hyperthymesics and Funes the Memorious. If we had evolved in an environment that favored other kinds of capacities rather than the ability to choose effective actions, the human mind would probably follow a different kind of logic than it does. If we evolved in a world that rewarded gambling on games of chance, we would probably be able to reason flawlessly about probability distributions and the laws of statistics. If we evolved in a world that rewarded deductive reasoning, we would probably all be like Spock, masterful at deducing conclusions. But most of us are miserable at both these things. Instead, we evolved in a world ruled by the logic of action, and that is why this kind of thought is so central to what makes us human. In the next chapter we will explain in more detail what the logic of action is and how it differs from other kinds of logic.',\n",

Start by helping one customer. Then another. This puts your focus on helping people immediately with what you’ve got available to you right now. Work on things like sales funnels and automation when it no longer makes sense to personalize your interactions with your customers in surprising and delightful ways.',\n",

In our universe, there is no past, and no future, but only a present that is being calculated at every instant. This instantaneous nature of reality is deep because it helps us connect statistical physics with computation. The instantaneous universe of Prigogine implies that the past is unreachable because it is incomputable at the micro level. Prigogine’s entropy barrier forbids the present to evolve into the past, except in idealized systems, like a pendulum or planetary orbits, which look the same going forward and backward (when there is no dissipation involved).',\n",

       "    'text': 'If you decide to go 10x from where you are now, your 10x future self will be a different person than you are now. In a short time, you’ll have freedoms you can’t presently fathom. The 10x value and quality of your time, money, relationships, and purpose will seem impossible to you now but will be completely normal to your 10x future self. Every time you commit to 10x, you’ll be required to go through the same process. In the first chapter of this book, you will learn the details of this 10x process. You’ll begin to see exactly why 10x and 2x are direct opposites, and why 10x is far easier, simpler, and more exciting than 2x. This process is highly imaginative, strategic, and practical. In the second chapter, you’ll learn how to commit to 10x and transform yourself and your identity through that commitment. This is the emotional aspect of the 10x process, which is where the rubber meets the road. Having 10x goals is one thing. But making 10x your standard, now that’s a different ball game, one that takes pure commitment and courage. That’s a game that will transform your entire life if you’re serious about it, but it’s also the only way to expand yourself and be free. Thus, you’ll learn to make 10x your standard and say “No” to increasingly great things, sharpening and refining your filter and identity. In the third chapter, you’ll learn the difference between wanting and needing. To go 10x, you shift all of your energy away from a “needing” perspective of life and the world. You don’t need to go 10x, you want to. The highest form of freedom is based on want, not need. Choosing what you want takes radical honesty, commitment, and courage. This is how you begin peeling away the layers and getting to the root and core of who you are. The more honest you get with yourself, the more you’ll clarify and develop your Unique Ability, which is your superpower as a person and entrepreneur, and it’s completely unique to you. Avoiding your Unique Ability leads to a life of frustration and mediocrity. Opening yourself up and developing your Unique Ability takes vulnerability, commitment, and courage—it’s like climbing a mountain and jumping off a cliff at the same time. The more layers you peel away by going 10x, the more you become your own version of the David, and the more valuable and purposeful your life will be. In the fourth chapter, you will be shown a different perspective of your own past, enabling you to better see and appreciate all the 10x jumps you’ve already made. You’ll connect the key dots that brought you to this point and use that throughline to lay out the next qualitative and non-linear 10x jumps your soul is most calling for. You’ll learn how to normalize 10x so that it becomes an increasingly natural way to live—seeing and feeling it through both your past and your future. The fifth chapter will help you shift out of the linear and quantitative model of time that is taught in public education and continued in most of corporate America.…',\n",

       "    'text': 'Chapter Takeaways Seemingly impossible goals are more practical than possible goals because impossible goals force you outside your current level of knowledge and assumptions. Very few pathways create 10x. With genuine reflection, a 10x target spotlights the few pathways—the high-leverage strategies and relationships—with extreme upside. 10x goals enable you to clearly identity the 20 percent of things and people in your life that are producing most of your results, and the 80 percent of things and people in your life that are holding you back. Going for 2x growth means you can keep 80 percent of your existing clients, roles, behaviors, and mindsets. Only minor tweaks are needed. Going for 10x growth means you must eliminate 80 percent of your existing clients, roles, behaviors, and mindsets. 10x requires a full-scale transformation of yourself as well as everyone and everything around you. 2x is linear—to continue growing requires more effort. It’s working harder, not smarter. It’s quantitatively focused—you’re just doing more of what you’re now doing without respect to quality, uniqueness, or transformation. 10x is non-linear—enormous growth does not require more effort, but often requires less, but better. It’s qualitatively focused—you’ve elevated your vision and focus such that you’re now transforming the value and impact of what you do for increasingly specific people. Every time you make a 10x jump, you do so by letting go of your current 80 percent and going deeper into a more powerful and concentrated 20 percent. Letting go of your 80 percent generally involves hiring Whos to take over your 80 percent, and to systemize and organize what is repeatable so you can innovate what isn’t repeatable. Every time you go 10x by letting go of the 80 percent and going all-in on your desired 20 percent, you dramatically increase your quality and quantity of your freedoms as a person—which are time, money, relationships, and purpose.',\n",

As you commit to a specific standard far above your current capability and confidence, it pushes you outside your knowledge and comfort zone: hence, courage. Through courageously adapting toward your commitment, you experience many “losses” and failures along the way, which you can utilize as feedback and learning. By adapting and applying your learning, you develop capabilities and skills you previously didn’t have, which you would not have developed without having fully made the commitment. Commitment leads to mastery, wherein you’ve normalized the new standard. At this level, you have a higher degree of confidence.5 You’re now your 10x self, and it’s completely normal to you, despite the fact that both who you now are and your normal life are unfathomable to your past self.

To be psychologically flexible, you become increasingly comfortable and adaptive to situations and challenges which are initially uncomfortable to you.

As you evolve and expand yourself as a context, the content of your life—inside and out—simultaneously changes as well.15,16 You commit to the standards you want, even when it’s uncomfortable for a brief time. By embracing your emotions rather than suppressing them, your identity quickly adapts to your new standards and you reach a place of acceptance.17,18,19,20 You’ve emotionally evolved and expanded as a person, wherein you feel comfortable and natural at the new standard.

       "    'text': 'Chapter Takeaways Going 10x involves the continuous process of increasing the quality and decreasing the quantity of everything you do. How you do anything is how you do everything. Shedding your 2x-identity can be difficult, because as people we have the tendency to avoid loss, overvalue what we currently own, and desire to be seen as consistent. Your identity is the story you believe about yourself and the standards you hold for yourself. Defining and choosing your own minimum standards, no matter how seemingly impossible to yourself and others, is fundamental to experiencing a 10x transformation. Evolving yourself to the level of a higher minimum standard requires commitment and courage, which eventually leads to the development of new capabilities and confidence (Dan’s 4C’s formula). Jimmy Donaldson’s three ingredients to his 10x process are: 1) thinking exponentially and non-linearly bigger, 2) hyper-focusing on quality over quantity, and 3) building a team to handle the 80 percent so you can focus and improve in your craft. 10x goals are easier than 2x goals for many reasons. 10x goals are less competitive. 10x goals require you to focus on very few things rather than many, which improves your brain’s ability to focus—research shows that continual task switching makes flow and high performance basically impossible.50,51 10x goals promote non-linear approaches which produce novel, innovative, and competition-free solutions. Finally, 10x goals foster leadership and teamwork, wherein you stop doing everything yourself, managing others, or needing to be right. Creating 10x results doesn’t require you to be 10x better than everyone else. Even being 10–20 percent better (and different) from everything else can produce 10x bigger results than even the outliers of a particular niche or field.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Chapter Takeaways Society trains people to believe freedom and creativity are scarce resources to compete for. This is not true because money is a finite resource, while wealth is an infinite resource. When you choose freedom over security, then you embrace a life where you choose exactly what you want, rather than vying for what you think you need. Living a life based on intrinsic wants enables an abundance mindset that allows you to create the wealth and life you want, without needing to justify to anyone why you want what you want. Living a life based on external needs enables a scarcity mindset that causes you to compete for the limited resources you believe you need. People who live based on need feel they have to justify their actions so that others will accept them. You must make a choice here and now: Will you continue living in the “needing” world where you must compete for scarce resources and justify everything you do, or will you embrace the “wanting” world where you freely choose, create, and get what you want? You can only go 10x by embracing a purely wanting approach to life, because 10x isn’t inherently something anyone needs, but only something you can have if you choose the freedom to want and create it. Your Unique Ability is a central and core aspect of who you are, which can only be uncovered and developed by embracing what you most want. Your Unique Ability is the way in which you provide the most value for other people, which no one else could ever replicate even if they wanted to. Your Unique Ability is more valuable and exciting than any specific industry or skill, though it can be utilized effectively toward specific activities such as teaching, leading, strategizing, etc. Overly linking your Unique Ability to any single activity, such as teaching, will inhibit your ability to evolve both yourself and your Unique Ability to higher levels. Your Unique Ability is what drives your best and most exciting performance. Being in a flow state occurs when you embrace your Unique Ability because you’re not overly editing yourself based on external approval, attachment to outcomes, etc. Instead, you’re just purely free to be and do and create as you want and in the way you want. You’re completely free and energized as a result and the byproduct is inspired creativity. This is also why and how you transform and expand your Unique Ability to otherworldly levels, wherein you become uniquely skilled and masterful at what you do. To become a true master at what you do, you can’t merely be an expert at something. Expertise is the ability to do something well. Mastery is the ability to do something uniquely well. A master is someone who can never be replicated, they can only be learned from. Embracing your Unique Ability is how you develop Mastery as a person, and become the highest and most genuine version of yourself. When you embrace and take your Unique Ability seriously, you immediately remove yourself from ever competing with…',\n",

       "    'text': \"The Importance of Behaviour Change in BASB\\n\\nKey takeaways:\\n- Simplistic promises of a magic solution are rarely true, especially when it comes to productivity\\n- Personal process of behavior change is different for every individual\\n- No formula or template exists to guarantee productivity improvement\\n\\nTranscript:\\nSpeaker 1\\nI really there's ll these promises out there. Just buy this thing, just acquire this product, just down load this ap. You don't have to change. You don't have to do anything different. Just buy this not in your life, the magic pill, or the silver bullet, or the hail mary. Which i get it is so attractive, very like, who wants to change? We just want to, you know, acquire something and have it and have it transform our lives. But it's just so rare. If ever that is that that is true, especially in the world of productivity. If there was any silver bullet, you know, it would be a and all ar business. Ah, and so i think you really just can't fall for those, those kind of simplicitic promises. Ah, and this is why i teach you this as a chourse. By the way, people enter the chorus, they think there's like a formula or a templet. There's not. There truly is not. You have to go through this personal process of vior change, which is different for every single person. Rit what works for you may not at all work for me, and vice versa. It depends on your life style, your your temperament, your personality, your use cases, your profession, your background, your skill like, all these things that are so different from person to person. So really, you can think of building second brain as a, yes, it's a meno knowledge management method, but it's also a behavior change method, because all the benefits come when you change the way you are being, the way you are acting towards information in your life. And sawfor is just a facilitator of that.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nGot your midea completely. I was thinking of em just from my own personal experience, lik outside of work. Let to say, let's us say e eating better food, right? Like, cause all of us are generally trying to eat healthier and be healthier in general, right? So in the past, i've done this thing whete i've gone very, very extreme. And i'm a pretty extreme person. So i'm ever going, you know, ham on one side, or i'm going, o'm extra clean a, drinking green juice every day.\",\n",

It goes by many names.\\n\\nThe important thing to understand is that this kind of energy is your birthright. You can call upon it any time you want. When this energy fills you, you feel like you can take on anything. It gushes up spontaneously from within and washes over you in waves, restoring and replenishing you.\\n\\nWhich raises the question: What causes us to stop feeling this energy?\\n\\nThere are various energy centers in the human body, which the yogis call “chakras.” The one we are most familiar with is the heart. Singer asserts that when something happens to us that we believe shouldn’t have happened, we decide to close our heart center and cut ourselves off from this energy source.',\n",

We tend to stick more and more with a point of view, the more someone else argues against it. And it often does not make any difference at all whether the other person might be right. By taking short breaks of Pinakarri we get the chance of »cooling down«. Pinakarri is also helpful to double check what we really want. In silence we can listen to what is going on inside us and see whether this or that point is still important to us',\n",

       "    'text': 'A little guide to Pinakarri Calm yourself and connect with your body: 1. Feel where your body connects with the chair or cushion you are sitting on 2. Feel the weight of your body: Notice your weight and how the earth supports it. This gravity is the oldest force in the universe. If this was a person supporting you, you would call it unconditional love. Become aware of the unconditional love of the Earth for you, the support it gives you. 3. Breathe deeply – in and out: Hear the difference in tone and feel the difference in temperature between the in-breath and the out-breath. This difference in temperature comes from the sun. Who are you? You are the dance of the material cycles of the Earth with the energy of the sun. 4. Can you hear the drumbeat of your heart? This has been with you since before you were born and will be with you until the moment of your death. 5. Find the point where the tension or energy in your body is strongest. Breathe into that spot, consciously relax and breathe out the tension. 6. You have now silenced the little voice in your head. There are many ways to achieve Pinakarri. Feel invited to experiment and find your own.\\nHint: As with Pinakarri, there are many ways of presencing yourself and speaking charismatically. Hints can be found in the works of Non-Violent Communication, Theory U by Otto Scharmer, and Facilitation as a spiritual practice of John Herron, as well as Community Building according to M. Scott Peck.',\n",

By doing this they allow their projects to speak through themselves… Do not forget to debrief and share what has been noticed. 1. Practice Pinakarri; sit upright and close your eyes. Breathe in deeply. Breathing deeply helps you to get rid of fear and tension. Become aware where you are connected with the earth (through your feet). Feel how your spine connects you with the sky. 2. Move your attention from your head to just below your navel; this is your Hara, the center of balance. 3. Using your imagination visualize the bubble of personal space which surrounds every person you are speaking to. Now visualize your own bubble; size, shape and color. Now make the bubble expand in size until it finally embraces, holds and lovingly supports the bubble of those you are speaking to. 4.

And so when you look at all the folks, especially the people who I interact with who are putting a lot of time and money and blood sweat and tears into their physical fitness or their mental fitness, there's nothing wrong with that. But that's often extremely imbalanced with the amount of time that they're dedicating to the so-called spiritual disciplines that build spiritual fitness or spiritual stamina. And I'm talking about things like fasting and meditation and prayer and silence and solitude and study and nature immersion and nature set spots and playing music and singing and being in relationships and learning how to make those relationships thriving and focusing on things like faith and family, even before the focus is placed upon things like help or finances. And, you know, when you step back and you look at yourself as a soul with a body, you realize that it's not only as important, but it's more important to train that soul every day to build it up to make it stronger so that you can be better equipped to live your life's purpose and also so that you can be ultimately fulfilled because that soul is, it's like an eternal whole in our soul and in our body and the only thing that can fill an eternal whole are things that are eternal and those are more of the spiritual practices than they are the physical practices. And trust me, as a guy who relied upon my own strength and my own fitness and my body and my image and how good I looked in spandex or how strong my abs were for a very long time, it really took me taking a deep dive into actually dedicating myself morning and evening to things like meditation and prayer and silence and solitude and devotions and training the spirit to really get\",\n",

It's before coffee hits your bloodstream and great amounts of sunlight and bright light hit your bloodstream, preferably, of course, before you've turned on your phone and cortisol has enhanced that awakening response even more. Well, you are primed right then to basically go into spiritual training mode. So within that first hour of waking, I've got a cushion on the living room floor or outside in the patio. I put on music because it really helps to shift your state even more. I play a station called soaking worship, which is really great instrumental music for things like worship and prayer. I always have some kind of a devotional that I'm working through in reading. Typically, I have other literature open in front of me. In my case, it's the Bible. And I'm actually reading the devotional, reading the Bible. And then once I finish, I open up my prayer book and I pray for people who I've committed to pray for. And then I'll just sit there after I've prayed and listen for any still small voice in the silence. Listen for any message that God might be sending to me. And if that happens, I can write it down in my journal. And so that's typically around like 6 a.m. And also that's like 6 to 6, 15, or 6, 20. We're not talking about having to become like a Tibetan monk who's spending hours each day when he's having practices. But then I'll head down to my office. I'll get some work done, I'll have some coffee, I'll go about my day. The family is all up by 7.30 at the latest. So I come up out of my office at 7.30 and I gather the whole family. And we do a practice of gratitude, tapping, breath work. And then writing down a person who we can serve or pray for or help that day. And then we have a big team huddle. We listen to some music like an uplifting song or we sing a song together. And it's like the big team spiritual chargeup for the family at the beginning of the day. So that means that by about 8 a.m. I've had two touch points to train my spirit, my own solo time within an hour after I get up. And then the gathering of the family, which is super special and really, really good for keeping the family bonded as well. It just helps get everybody on the same page in a really good space in the morning. Now, I like the concept of book ending that practice. And so in the evening, we gather the whole family, we go to my son's bedroom, their twins, and they sleep in the same room. So that makes it easy. We play some music, I play guitar song. And then we do a process of what's called self examination. I talk about in this in my book, you visualize your entire day. And you see yourself like in the third person going through your entire day, like a character in a movie. As you're watching that character of you in the movie, you're asking yourself, what good have I done this day? What can I have done better this day? Meaning what failures have I learned from? And then where was I most purpose filled on this day? And that last question, well, but all the questions are, they're impactful. But that last question, you'll find yourself over the course of just a month, you know, answering that question, but getting to learn more about what your unique skill set is, what is it your call to? I felt most purpose filled when I was, when I was writing a chapter in a book that I'm working on. Or I felt most purpose filled when I took time off work and started just making\",\n",

What could they have done better? Where were they most purpose-filled?\\n- The ritual ends with a final prayer before going to bed.\\n\\nTranscript:\\nSpeaker 2\\nRitual, the one that you do before you go to bed. You said you all set your twin's bedroom and break that down for us.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYou know, every night's kind of like a party at our house fishing, like I so look forward to the end of the day because no matter whether we have visitors or not, about 7 p.m., we're all gathered as a family in the kitchen and we're cooking and making a meal together and laughing and playing music and joking and talking about each other's days. And so around 730 or so, we've got some kind of dinner prepared. And then I lead the family in a song. And I let my sons typically choose the song. But we play a wonderful song, kind of like have a campfire sing along around the dinner table, you know, just one song, like three or four minutes. And we sit down and we play games all night long. We have card games and board games and talking games and table topics games. We play games typically for about an hour. And then when that finishes, it's wonderful because my kids are learning all sorts of game theory and language and rhetoric and math and logic and all these things. They didn't realize they're learning. It's kind of like sneaking vegetables into their spaghetti sauce when they play games every night at the table. But it's a great, great way to come together at the end of the day. And then we clean the kitchen together, take care of any final chores, like closing up the chicken coop or closing the garage or putting on the alarm. And we all go upstairs into my son's room. I typically have my guitar or my ukulele with me. And I'll play everybody a song. And then we all gather together, just kind of snuggle up on the beds. And we open up our journals again, same journals. And now there's a bottom half to each page. And that bottom half of those three questions I mentioned earlier. What good have I done? What could I have done better? And where was I most connected to my life's purpose? So for the first minute or two, we just do deep breathing, about an eight count in. I'm sorry, a four count in and an eight count out. So we're breathing. We're exhaling longer than we inhale, which is a really, really good way to relax the body and activate the parasympathetic nurse system at the end of the day. And then once we've done a couple of minutes of that breathing, then I tell the family, OK, begin to visualize your day. And we all know the questions we're going to answer. So we start to visualize the day. And as we watch ourselves like that third person character in a movie, like I was talking about earlier, we ask ourselves, OK, what good did I do? What could I have done better? What failures did I learn from? Where was I most purpose filled? And everybody has the understanding that whether it takes you two minutes to write all that down and visualize, or whether it takes four or five minutes, once you've finished, you return back to the breathing. After a few minutes, Dad will kind of glance around the room and see if everybody's journals are still open or closed, see where everybody's at in their process. And then I will basically break the silence with a final prayer, a prayer that God would watch over the home. We'd be surrounded by angels while we sleep and everyone would wake refreshed and ready to live out their life's purpose. And so we say a prayer and then we go to bed. And so that's kind of what the end of the day looks like.\",\n",

But if you look at something like the Bible, right, it says that we are to pray without ceasing. That's not like a recommendation. It's actually like a commandment, pray without ceasing. What's that mean to me? Basically it means that I have, and this is magical to think about, an intelligent power acting over me is like, not just a strict ruler, but as a father, as a friend. And I can talk to that power anytime. I can ask them for things, not like a magical genie to grant my wishes, but more like, I just need strength right now. I don't have strength or I need energy right now. I don't have energy or please help me to get through this or what should I choose to do here about this difficult discussion I'm having with a coworker or an employee? And it's this idea that when you know somebody's got your back and there's someone or something that you can talk to, even if all the world has left you behind and there's like this bosom that you can lay your head in when you're tired or when you're hungry or when you're broken and someone's there just like stroking your hair and taking care of you. I mean, that's what prayer is for me. It's like this reliance upon a higher power and the knowledge and the hope that I don't have to go at it alone and it can be everything from, you know, me bowing my head before a meal and saying, oh, thank you for this meal. And please also be with my mom right now and let her just feel a whole bunch of comfort right now because she's going through a hard time. Or it can be before bed at night. God, I've got a lot going through my mind right now. I give everyone and everything to you. I'm just going to hand all this to you. I know you've got under control and I'm going to lay my head down on my pillow and go to sleep right now, right? So there's not like one perfect way to pray. I actually really like prayer books. There's some beautiful prayer books out there. The one I'm using right now and the one that I actually use in the morning when we say prayer as a family is called the piercing the heavens, piercing the heavens. And it was written by a group of Puritans and Puritans\",\n",

I was having a conversation with Jean Houston and I don't know if you've heard of Jean Houston, but she's like 83 years old. She is one of the Buckminster Fuller called her a living legend and she is one of the most respected women in the spiritual personal growth movement in the United States. And Jean Houston, I asked her if you were in Mindvalley, what would you teach? We were having a conversation just last week and she mentioned I would teach people how to work with that which you cannot see, with the unseen, with the spirit that is all around us. And I said, well, give me an example. And she shared a really fascinating story. She said, vision have been around for decades, right? And I've got to meet many of the most remarkable people in the world. And there was a time I was working with Mother Teresa in India. And I asked Mother Teresa, how do you do all of these things that you do? Because you're everywhere, you're feeding like a million people, you have all of this energy at your age. And Mother Teresa said, well, I do it because I collaborate with my beloved Jesus. And so Jean said, you mean you pray Mother Teresa goes, no, no, Jesus and I, we have a pact. Like we work together, like he is like, we literally work together and he removes all of the obstacles that come in my way. And this is how I'm able to do all the stuff that I do. Now, I\",\n",

Now, I see this in so many amazing people today. Very often they are reluctant to bring in religion because you know, as you mentioned, there is that part of religion that can be problematic. But I do this, I pray every single day. And it's part of me. And I really want more people to understand that there are things that we cannot see that are all around us. They are forces. They are, there's a spirit around us. We can't necessarily reduce it to science. No, I don't think we need to. But there's enough evidence that when we call upon and ask for this help, amazing things happen.\\n\\nSpeaker 1\\nYeah, you're right. It's very easy to shrug it off as a dump of DMT from the pineal gland or a soup of neurotransmitters and neurochemicals like serotonin just kind of hanging around the synaptic cleft from some funky mushroom that you ate or something like that. But the fact is that, you know, there are certain means via which the spiritual world interacts with human beings. It can be, you know, via plants, via sex, via breath work, via simply sitting and praying. And I think there are some dangers associated with certain elements, you know, I think that, you know, like seeking the advice of gods via, you know, like pharma wasca or something like that can kind of open up the portal to some darker influences if you're not very, very careful. I think some of that is abused these days. But ultimately, it'd be, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who has, for example, had a plant medicine experience or experienced a wonderful, wonderful prayer and worship session at church or has been out on a nature walk. And all of a sudden, felt their spidey sense go up and had tingles and all of a sudden been washed over with the magic of nature and God revealing himself through nature who would return from experience like that and say, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's just all chemicals. Right? And so the problem is you just get laughed at a lot these days if you try to, you know, all of the existence of things like, oh, you know, fairies and elves and angels and demons and blah, blah, blah. But you know what? I think that, like I said, it's a pretty magical way to live when you know you're part of this fantasy story and there actually is existence of a spiritual universe because by the nature of you believing that your soul will go on to live forever, well, it's got to go somewhere, right? And so there is this spiritual ether that we will wind up and I don't know what that's gonna look like. But I do know that it can be amazing, it can be beautiful, it can be blissful and by you taking care of your spirit and, you know, and seeking to acknowledge and commune with these higher powers, you're actually kind of on the road to ensuring that your soul does go on to a better place.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\nWhat do you abuse recently you came\",\n",

This is perfectly normal. Ken Wilbur calls this the pre-trans policy. He says basically that as we grow as a society, there are different people in different strata of understanding of the world. And there's a particular aspect of people in Integral Theory called the rationalists. So the rationalists, you find these people in Silicon Valley, scientists tend to be very rationalist. The people in Wall Street, very rationalists. It's the world by numbers. Now, when you're at the rational level, what happens is that you only see the world by numbers, by data, and you confuse a very important aspect of human evolution. You confuse pre-rational ideas and or rather you confuse pre-rational spirituality and trans-rational spirituality. Trans-rational means the spirituality that comes after the rational age. So pre-rational spirituality is the spirituality of the Middle Ages, right? When you believe burning witches at the stake, when you believe in ideas that were put out by the church to more or press people, trans-rational spirituality is the spirituality that's emerging now in the world. It's meditation, it's prayer, it's plant medicine, it's accessing intuitive insight, it's working with your energy body, but you don't see that. So you confuse the two. So concepts which are proven by science, the idea that we have an energy body, even reincarnation, there's so much evidence for it. The idea of intuition, so much evidence, but you label it as magical thinking. If you're at the rational level, you label it as magical thinking because you confuse trans-rational spirituality with pre-rational spirituality. And that's why you have people who say, don't talk about your faith. Now, nothing wrong there, they\",\n",

Over the past thirty years it has become clear that a full understanding of these issues\\nrequires nothing less than a radically new conception of life. And indeed, such a new understanding of life is now emerging. At the forefront of contemporary science, we no longer see the universe as a machine composed of elementary building blocks. We have discovered that the material world, ultimately, is a network of inseparable patterns of relationships; that the planet as a whole is a living, self-regulating system. The view of the human body as a machine and of the mind as a separate entity is being replaced by one that sees not only the brain, but also the immune system, the bodily tissues, and even each cell as a living, cognitive system. Evolution is no longer seen as a competitive struggle for existence, but rather as a cooperative dance in which creativity and the constant emergence of novelty are the driving forces. And with the new emphasis on complexity, networks, and patterns of organization, a new science of qualities is slowly emerging.',\n",

The argument was: do you ask what it is made of – earth, fire, water, etc. – or do you askwhat its pattern is? Ever since early Greek philosophy, there has been this tension between substance and\\npattern. Aristotle, the first biologist in the Western tradition, distinguished between four causes as interdependent sources of all phenomena: the material cause, the formal cause, the efficient cause, and the final cause. The first two causes refer to the two perspectives of substance and pattern which, following Aristotle, we shall call the perspective of matter and the perspective of form. The study of matter begins with the question, “What is it made of?” This leads to the\\nnotions of fundamental elements, building blocks; to measuring and quantifying. The study of form asks, “What is the pattern?” And that leads to the notions of order, organization, and relationships. Instead of quantity, it involves quality; instead of measuring, it involves mapping.',\n",

       "    'text': 'For the ancient Greek philosophers, the world was a kosmos, an ordered and harmonious structure. From its beginnings in the sixth century BC, Greek philosophy and science understood the order of the cosmos to be that of a living organism rather than a mechanical system. This meant for them that all its parts had an innate purpose to contribute to the harmonious functioning of the whole, and that objects moved naturally toward their proper places in the universe. Such an explanation of natural phenomena in terms of their goals, or purposes, is known as teleology, from the Greek telos (“purpose”). It permeated virtually all of Greek philosophy and science. The view of the cosmos as an organism also implied for the Greeks that its general properties are reflected in each of its parts. This analogy between macrocosm and microcosm, and in particular between the Earth and the human body, was articulated most eloquently by Plato in his Timaeus in the fourth century BC, but it can also be found in the teachings of the Pythagoreans and other earlier schools. Over time, the idea acquired the authority of common knowledge, and this continued throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. In early Greek philosophy, the ultimate moving force and source of all life was identified\\nwith the soul, and its principal metaphor was that of the breath of life. Indeed, the root meaning of both the Greek psyche and the Latin anima is “breath.”\\nClosely associated with that moving force, the breath of life that leaves the body at death, was the idea of knowing. For the early Greek philosophers, the soul was both the source of movement and life, and that which perceives and knows. Because of the fundamental analogy between microcosm and macrocosm, the individual soul was thought to be part of the force that moves the entire universe, and accordingly the knowing of an individual was seen as part of a universal process of knowing. Plato called it the anima mundi, the “world soul.”',\n",

Faraday and Maxwell not only studied the effects of the electric and magnetic forces but also made the forces themselves the primary objects of their investigation. By replacing the concept of a force with the much subtler concept of a field, they were the first to go beyond Newtonian physics, showing that fields had their own reality and could be studied without any reference to material bodies.

DNA was often referred to as the organism’s genetic “program” or “blueprint,” and the genetic code as the universal “language of life.” The exclusive focus on genes implied by these metaphors largely eclipsed the organism from the biologists’ view. Living organisms tended to be viewed simply as collections of genes, subject to random mutations and selective forces in the environment over which they have no control. Further research in genetics, however, forced molecular biologists to realize that the\\nelegant principle of “one gene – one protein” had to be abandoned, and in spite of many brilliant achievements the awareness that we may need to go beyond genes to really understand genetic phenomena is now increasing. Indeed, some geneticists are even speculating that we may be forced to abandon the concept of the gene altogether, as we discuss in Section 9.6.',\n",

Petty’s Political Arithmetick seemed to owe much to Newton, Descartes, and Galileo, its method consisting of replacing words and arguments by numbers, weights and measures, and of using rational arguments to explain economic phenomena in terms of visible natural causes.

Since the early days of organismic biology, these multileveled structures of systems\\nwithin systems have been called hierarchies. However, this term can be misleading, since it is derived from human hierarchies, which are fairly rigid structures of domination and control, quite unlike the multileveled order found in nature. We shall see in Section 4.1.5 that the important concept of living networks provides a new perspective on the so-called “hierarchies” of nature. What the early systems thinkers recognized very clearly is the existence of different\\nlevels of complexity with different kinds of laws operating at each level. Thus the notion of “organized complexity” became another key concept. At each level of complexity, the observed phenomena exhibit properties that do not exist at the lower level. For example, the concept of temperature, which is central to thermodynamics, is meaningless at the level of individual atoms where the laws of quantum theory operate. In the early 1920s, the philosopher C.D. Broad (1887–1971) coined the term “emergent properties” for those properties that emerge at a certain level of complexity but do not exist at lower levels.',\n",

Correspondingly, the flows of matter and energy through ecosystems were perceived as the continuation of the metabolic pathways through organisms. The view of living systems as networks provides a novel perspective on the so-called “hierarchies” of nature. Since living systems at all levels are networks, we must visualize the web of life as living systems (networks) interacting in network fashion with other systems (networks). For example, we can picture an ecosystem schematically as a network with a few nodes. Each node represents an organism, which means that each node, when magnified, appears itself as a network. Each node in the new network may represent an organ, which in turn will appear as a network when magnified, and so on. In other words, the web of life consists of networks within networks. At each scale,\\nunder closer scrutiny, the nodes of the network reveal themselves as smaller networks. We tend to arrange these systems, all nesting within larger systems, in a hierarchical scheme by placing the larger systems above the smaller ones in pyramid fashion. But this is a human projection. In nature, there is no “above” or “below,” and there are no hierarchies. There are only networks nesting within other networks.',\n",

Cells are parts of tissues; tissues are parts of organs, organs parts of organisms; and living organisms are parts of ecosystems and social systems. At each level the living system is an integrated whole with smaller components, while at the same time being a part of a larger whole. Ultimately – as quantum physics showed so impressively – there are no parts at all. What we call a part is merely a pattern in an inseparable web of relationships. Therefore, the shift of perspective from the parts to the whole can also be seen as a shift from objects to relationships. In a sense, this is a figure/ground shift, as illustrated in Figure 4.1. In the mechanistic view\\n(a) the world is a collection of objects. The objects interact with one another, and hence there relationships between them. But the relationships (dotted lines) are secondary. In the systems view (b), we realize that the objects themselves are networks of relationships, embedded in larger networks. For the systems thinker, the relationships are primary. The boundaries (dotted lines) of the discernible patterns – the so-called “objects” – are secondary.',\n",

By studying both forms of organizational dynamics and illustrating them with numerous examples from natural and social systems, Bogdanov explored several key ideas pursued by organismic biologists and by cyberneticists. The dynamics of formation consists of the joining of complexes through various kinds\\nof linkages, which Bogdanov analyzed in great detail. He emphasized in particular that the tension between crisis and transformation is central to the formation of complex systems. Foreshadowing the work of Ilya Prigogine (see Chapter 8), Bogdanov showed how organizational crisis manifests itself as a breakdown of the existing systemic balance and at the same time represents a transition to a new state of balance. By defining categories of crises, Bogdanov even anticipated the concept of catastrophe developed in the 1960s by the French mathematician Ren´e Thom, which later on, under the name of “bifurcation,” became a key concept of complexity theory (see Chapter 6).',\n",

       "    'text': 'Bertalanffy pinpointed a dilemma that had puzzled scientists since\\nthe nineteenth century, when the novel idea of evolution entered into scientific thinking. Whereas Newtonian mechanics was a science of forces and trajectories, evolutionary thinking – thinking in terms of change, growth, and development – required a new science of complexity. The first formulation of this new science was classical thermodynamics with its celebrated “second law,” the law of the dissipation of energy. As we discussed in Section 1.2.3, the second law of thermodynamics presented scientists with the fundamental dilemma oftwo diametrically opposed views of evolutionary change – that of a living world unfolding toward increasing order and complexity, and that of an engine running down, a world of ever-increasing disorder. Ludwig von Bertalanffy could not resolve this dilemma, but he took the crucial first step by recognizing that living organisms are open systems that cannot be described by classical thermodynamics. He called such systems “open” because they need to feed on a continual flux of matter and energy from their environment to stay alive.\\nUnlike closed systems, which settle into a state of thermal equilibrium, open systems\\nmaintain themselves far from equilibrium in this “steady state” characterized by continual flow and change. Bertalanffy coined the German term Fliessgleichgewicht (“flowing balance”) to describe such a state of dynamic balance. He recognized clearly that classical thermodynamics, which deals with closed systems at or near equilibrium, is inappropriate to describe open systems in steady states far from equilibrium.',\n",

The crucial difference is embodied in Norbert Wiener’s concept of feedback and is expressed in the very meaning of “cybernetics.” A feedback loop is a circular arrangement of causally connected elements, in which an initial cause propagates around the links of the loop, so that each element has an effect on the next, until the last “feeds back” the effect into the first element of the cycle (see Figure 5.1).

Perhaps the circular nature of such self-amplifying, “runaway” feedback loops was recognized explicitly much earlier, because their effect is much more dramatic than the self-balancing of the negative feedback loops that are so wide-spread in the living world. There are other common metaphors to describe self- amplifying feedback phenomena.\\nThe “self-fulfilling prophecy,” in which originally unfounded fears lead to actions that make the fears come true, and the “bandwagon effect” – the tendency of a cause to gain support simply because of its growing number of adherents – are two well-known examples. In spite ofthe extensive knowledge ofself-amplifying feedback in common folkwisdom,\\nit played hardly any role during the first phase of cybernetics. The cyberneticists around Norbert Wiener acknowledged the existence of runaway feedback phenomena but did not study them any further.

It began with the Pythagoreans in Greece and was continued by Leonardo da Vinci, Paracelsus, the Romantic poets, and various other intellectual movements. However, for most of the time the study of pattern was eclipsed by the study of matter until it re-emerged forcefully in our century, when it was recognized by systems thinkers as essential to the understanding of life. The study of pattern is crucial to the understanding of living systems because systemic properties, as we discussed in Section 4.1.2, arise from a configuration of ordered relationships. Systemic properties are properties of a pattern. What is destroyed when a living organism is dissected is its pattern. The components are still there, but the configuration of relationships between them – the pattern – is destroyed, and thus the organism dies. Once the importance of pattern for the understanding of life is appreciated, it becomes\\nnatural to ask: Is there a common pattern of organization that can be identified in all living systems?We shall see in Chapter 7 that this is indeed the case. As the early systems thinkers discovered, themost important property of this pattern oforganization, common to all living systems, is that it is a network pattern. Whenever we encounter living systems – organisms, parts of organisms, or communities of organisms – we can observe that their components are arranged in network fashion. Whenever we look at life, we look at networks.',\n",

Nonlinear dynamics is the first mathematics that enables scientists to deal with the full complexity of these nonlinear phenomena. The exploration of nonlinear systems over the past decades has had a profound impact\\non science as a whole, as it has forced us to re-evaluate some very basic notions about the relationships between a mathematical model and the phenomena it describes. One of those notions concerns our understanding of simplicity and complexity. In the world of linear equations we thought we knew that systems described by simple\\nequations behaved in simpleways, while those described by complicated equations behaved in complicated ways. In the nonlinear world – which includes most of the real world, as we have discovered – simple deterministic equations may produce an unsuspected richness and variety of behavior. On the other hand, complex and seemingly chaotic behavior can give rise to ordered structures, to subtle and beautiful patterns. In fact, in chaos theory the term “chaos” has acquired a new technical meaning. The behavior of chaotic systems only appears to be random but in reality shows a deeper level of patterned order. As we shall see in the following pages, the new mathematical techniques enable us to make these underlying patterns visible in distinct shapes. Another important property of nonlinear equations, which has been very disturbing to\\nscientists, is that exact prediction is often impossible, even though the equations may be strictly deterministic. We shall see that this striking feature of nonlinearity has brought about an important shift of emphasis from quantitative to qualitative analysis.',\n",

This is a typical example of classical physics, where friction is generally neglected. A real pendulum will always have some friction that will slow it down so that, eventually, it will come to a halt. In the two-dimensional phase space, this motion is represented by a curve spiraling inward toward the center, as shown in Figure 6.8. The shape of a system’s trajectory in phase space is known as an “attractor.” A closed-loop\\ntrajectory, such as the one representing the frictionless pendulum, is called a “periodic attractor,” whereas a trajectory spiraling inward is called a “point attractor.” The reason for this choice of metaphor is that the attractor represents the system’s long-term dynamics. A complex system, typically, will move differently in the beginning, depending on how it starts off, but then will settle down to a characteristic long-term behavior, represented by its attractor. Metaphorically speaking, the trajectory is “attracted” to this pattern whatever its starting point may have been.',\n",

He found that the solutions to his equations were extremely sensitive to the initial conditions. From virtually the same starting point, two trajectories would develop in completely different ways, making any long-range prediction impossible. This discovery sent shock waves through the scientific community, which was used to\\nrelying on deterministic equations for predicting phenomena such as solar eclipses or the appearance of comets with great precision over long spans of time. It seemed inconceivable that strictly deterministic equations of motion should lead to unpredictable results. Yet, this was exactly what Lorenz discovered. The Lorenz model is not a realistic representation of a particular weather phenomenon,\\nbut it is a striking example of how a simple set of nonlinear equations can generate enormously complex behavior. Its publication in 1963 marked the beginning of chaos theory, and the model’s attractor, known as the Lorenz attractor ever since, became the most celebrated and most widely studied strange attractor.',\n",

This region is called the “basin of attraction” of that attractor. The phase space of a nonlinear system can often be partitioned into several basins of attraction, each embedding its separate attractor. The qualitative analysis of a dynamic system, then, consists in identifying the system’s\\nattractors and basins of attraction, and classifying them in terms of their topological characteristics. The result is a dynamical picture of the entire system, called the “phase portrait.” The mathematical methods for analyzing phase portraits are based on the pioneering work of Poincar´e and were further developed and refined by the topologist Stephen Smale in the early 1960s. Smale used his technique not only to analyze systems described by a given set of\\nnonlinear equations but also to study how those systems behave under small alterations of their equations.As the parameters of the equations change slowly, the phase portrait – that is, the shapes of its attractors and basins of attraction – will usually go through corresponding smooth alterations without any changes in its basic characteristics. Smale used the term “structurally stable” to describe such systems, in which small changes in the equations leave the basic character of the phase portrait unchanged.',\n",

       "    'text': '118 Complexity theory Figure 6.11 Geometric operation for constructing a Koch curve. Mandelbrot highlighted this dramatic feature of fractal shapes by asking a provocative\\nquestion: How long is the coast of Britain? He showed that, since the measured length can be extended indefinitely by going to smaller and smaller scales, there is no clear-cut answer to the question. However, it is possible to define a number between 1 and 2 that characterizes the jaggedness of the coast. For the British coastline this number is approximately 1.58; for the much rougher Norwegian coast, it is approximately 1.70. Since it can be shown that this number has certain properties of a dimension, Mandelbrot\\ncalled it a fractal dimension. We can understand this idea intuitively by realizing that a jagged line on a plane fills up more space than a smooth line, which has dimension 1, but less than the plane, which has dimension 2. The more jagged the line, the closer its fractal dimension will be to 2. Similarly, a crumpled-up piece of paper fills up more space than a plane but less than a sphere. Thus, the more tightly the paper is crumpled, the closer its fractal dimension will be to 3. This concept of a fractal dimension, which was at first a purely abstract mathematical\\nidea, has become a very powerful tool for analyzing the complexity of fractal shapes, because it corresponds very well to our experience of nature. The more jagged the outlines of lightning or the borders of clouds, the rougher the shapes of coastlines or mountains, the higher are their fractal dimensions.',\n",

Strictly\\nspeaking, it is not self-similar because it not only repeats the same patterns over and over again, including small replicas of the entire set, but also contains elements from an infinite number of Julia sets. It is thus a “superfractal” of inconceivable complexity. And yet this structure, whose richness defies the human imagination, is generated by a\\nfew very simple rules. Thus fractal geometry, like chaos theory, has forced scientists and mathematicians to re-examine the very concept of complexity. In classical mathematics, simple formulas correspond to simple shapes, complicated formulas to complicated shapes. In nonlinear dynamics the situation is dramatically different. Simple equations may generate enormously complex strange attractors, and simple rules of iteration give rise to structures more complicated than we can even imagine',\n",

In the twentieth century, however, increasing reductionism, fragmentation, and specialization led to an extreme isolation of mathematics, even within the scientific community. The great fascination exerted by chaos theory and fractal geometry on people in all disciplines – from scientists to managers to artists – may indeed be a hopeful sign that mathematics may be liberated from its recent isolation.

       "    'text': 'So I started assembling the ideas into a broader synthesis, and began noticing and collecting questions, ideas and examples from other domains. It seemed to me that the rich interplay of rhythms, emotions and energy was everywhere I looked: How was I making the apparently trivial decision of when to flip a pancake, against the backdrop of impatience, hunger, wrist-skill, and flame control? How, by focusing on my stroke and breathing, rather than my strength, was my swim coach able to lower my sprint times and the amount of energy I spent? How do musicians performing jam sessions decide what to play next? How do good managers steer a meeting? This was a complex set of questions, and I found myself groping for that key insight, that high-concept which would miraculously dissolve the complexity. The answer began to emerge from the research I was involved in at the time, on command and control.',\n",

A book that would weave the tragic passion of the humanities together with the unsentimental austerity of the mathematical decision sciences, to tell you the story of your life. The ideas in this book were inspired by questions from everyday life at work, home and play. I have tried to return to those worlds, and frame what I have to say as deeper insights into common sense. But this has not always been possible. Ideas from dusty academic journals and from rarefied domains of practice – such as boardrooms and the decks of aircraft carriers – are not always reducible to everyday experience. So yes, at times, you will need to stretch your mind. But you should expect and even welcome the challenge. You live in a complicated world, where you must contend with globe-spanning human decision processes that affect your life. Everything you need to know, you did not learn in kindergarten.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Momentum accumulates and degrades constantly during the dozens of micro-decisions we make every minute. The world changes so fast that most of these decisions go towards simply maintaining situation awareness: largely subconscious decisions about what beliefs to add, update or discard, a process that computer scientists call truth maintenance. For those decisions that do affect visible behavior, the classic metaphor of a fork in the road is inadequate. A better metaphor is the sort of continuous and complex decision-making involved in driving: as Tom Vanderbilt notes in Traffic,2 at 30 miles per hour, we are exposed to about 1,320 “items of information” per minute. You cannot manage this process one decision at a time. Neither can you selectively override your subconscious to only make the big decisions. This is the main reason tempo is a useful notion: it varies slowly enough that you can maintain an awareness of it, and use it to modulate the blurry torrent of your life. Being aware of tempo allows you to manage the momentum of your life. Managing momentum also means that when you do choose to slow down and pluck out individual consequential decisions for conscious and detailed processing, you won’t be the victim of conjuring tricks pulled on you by the mob of unruly autopilots – what Marvin Minsky called the “Society of Mind” – that exists just below conscious awareness.3 The more you consciously manage tempo, the more creative and realistic your options during the big decisions.',\n",

No physical musical instrument can sound a pure note; there is always a timbre or texture to every sound. The rhythms of every situation have a texture to them. The most basic decision-making skill is adapting to the tempo of your environment, and setting your own pace within it. It is significantly harder to become a pace-setter or pace-disruptor: somebody who can actually influence the tempo of the environment.

Part of this process is what is known in the military as developing situation awareness (sometimes called ‘situational awareness”): The perception of environmental elements within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future.‡ Appropriately generalized, with space replaced by virtual social environment, this definition applies to most kinds of modern information work.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Situation awareness degrades if it is not actively maintained through immersion, so context-switches are an asymmetric form of information work. Preparing your mind for the to domain is uphill work. Letting go of the from domain is downhill work. At work, for instance, it is easier to acquire the habit of making notes and capturing action items after a meeting, when the situation awareness is still strong in your mind. It is much harder to acquire the complementary habit of preparing adequately for meetings, since it is difficult to acquire the necessary situation awareness before actually entering the venue and encountering faces and voices. This asymmetry is one reason that start-up situation awareness rituals, such as agenda reviews and approval of minutes, are more common than exit rituals. Post-processing happens more naturally than pre-processing.',\n",

Of course, you notice (or anticipate) and classify the what, when, who and where of the situation, which allows you to quickly load the right mental model into awareness, but the main action centers around developing awareness of rhythms. The world moves faster than we can hope to keep up, and we adapt by separating change into a background of predictable rhythms, and a foreground of unusual rhythms and non-rhythmic elements.§ Without this separation into foreground and background, the sheer cognitive load of keeping up with change, the process of truth maintenance, would overwhelm us. So, rather efficiently, we hold the compact belief that ‘the sun rises and sets everyday” and relegate that belief to the background, rather than precisely tracking the sun at all times. Developing situation awareness is primarily the process of getting attuned to the dynamics of the background. Anything left over and unexplained is the foreground: raw material for active engagement.',\n",

In simple terms, if you've got a group that's working together, you may have noticed that there will typically be one or more people, within that group, who are really good at explaining how things work. Oftentimes, these very explainers are leaders. Of course, they may not be leaders in the animal sense, where they would be the first in the dominance hierarchy, but, in a lot of cases, they're really the intellectual or sometimes the cultural leaders.\\n● And then finally the leader is the definer of reality. Many years ago I read a book by Max Dupree about leadership that said: “The leader’s first job is to define reality.” I didn't know what that meant at the time, but after all these years I understand its value and meaning. If you think of yourself as a definer of reality, and you make that your very first priority, then you’ll go really far as a thought leader.\",\n",

At first you learn a lot, but when you get the swing of things, you end up doing the same thing over and over. As a knowledge entrepreneur, you do the opposite. You maximize the time spent learning. Therefore, you build up your most valuable asset way more than typical approaches to entrepreneurship and typical jobs.\\n● Learn What You Want To Learn. As a knowledge entrepreneur you focus on learning what is most important and interesting to you rather than something you are forced to learn, which doesn’t really have any personal impact and won’t be valuable in other areas of your life.\\n● Embrace Your Inner Learner. The knowledge entrepreneur path allows you to embrace your love of learning, create life-transforming results in your own life and other people’s lives. Whereas, in many positions, one has to stifle their inner learner, focus on short-term deadlines, and do learning on the side as a hobby.\\n● Scalable. Selling ideas is the most scalable business in the world. Therefore, you can scale to millions of dollars in revenue while still doing what you love and not having to hire a huge team that you manage. As many entrepreneurs scale, they do what needs to be done to grow the business. This often means doing things that aren’t the most exciting for them on a day-to-day basis.\\n● Build Up Assets That Can Pay You Back For Decades. It’s exciting to have courses that could last for years or even decades and keep paying you.',\n",

We also use the same process to represent abstract things, like concepts and words.

In the work that we're doing here, in the Mental Model Club, as well as in the work we do for our own brands, we’re working on building models of reality, life, business, and relationships.

       "    'text': 'Once you consider alternatives and have determined that training is the right way to address the problem, the Kite Method will help you tremendously. Start out by making sure you can answer these questions: Who are the participants? What are their characteristics, needs, anxieties, job titles, previous experiences, levels of expertise, etc.? Why are these the targeted participants? The more specific questions you can answer about your participants, the more powerful and focused your Kite will be. How long will your class be? The amount of time you have in which to deliver the class will dramatically influence everything about it. If you don’t know exactly, choose a time period NOW. You can always make changes in the future if necessary. Are you a content expert in the area for which you’re building the Kite? It’s important that you know a lot about your subject. You don’t have to know everything, but if you are a novice on this topic, you may want to work with at least one subject-matter expert. Don’t try to learn about a topic at the same time you are building the Kite ... you’ll get overwhelmed. What form will the Kite take? Will you develop classroom training,\\xa0a seminar for the community, a Webinar? Will you deliver it via teleconference, DVD, streaming video? (I focus on onsite and synchronous Webinar training throughout this handbook, but the guidelines can be used for training in any medium.) Who will build and deliver the Kite? Will you design and present the class on your own? Will you work with a small committee or an even larger group? Will you design the training and then pass it to someone else to train? (This book is primarily for those who develop and deliver training themselves, although others will find it useful.) Clarify: Will you present or train? When Confucius declared the following, he was speaking of training: What I hear, I forget.\\xa0 What I see, I remember.\\xa0 What I do, I understand. Presenting differs from training. Typically, presenting involves one-way communication; training is multi-directional and participatory. It builds skills. Although this book will help you develop a dynamic presentation, I wrote it specifically for those who want to build their participants’ skills through participation and interaction.',\n",

       "    'text': 'How Adults Learn As you set out to build your Kite, it’s important to understand what adults need to learn effectively. Keep this information in mind both as you build your Kite and when you fly it. Adults learn best when: They are actively involved in the learning. Who wants to sit around passively, watching other people enjoy flying their kites? The fun part is in the doing. That’s where learning occurs, too. Whether it’s a Webinar or onsite class, make it active and participatory. Your material connects with participants’ real-life experiences and emotions, whether in the past, present, or future. The learning experience goes deeper when it hooks into something your participants know or feel. Past: New information has a better chance of sticking if you connect it with your participants’ experiences, particularly emotional ones. What might be your participants’ gut feelings or visceral memories? Connect your message to these, and it will go deep. Present: Focus on the participants’ immediate needs. They’ll learn better when your material helps them perform necessary skills, reduces anxiety, or offers solutions to relevant, real-life problems. Future: Focus on the participants’ real concerns, anxieties, and hopes for the future. Emotion goes a long way in learning. You acknowledge and show that you care about each participant. Whether you are teaching onsite or online, you need to show authentic interest in your participants. Ask a bit about them in pre- class conversations. Request photographs before online sessions. Match names to faces. Share a bit about yourself. Model your belief that learning is a collaborative experience.',\n",

Participants should be able to demonstrate the learning outcome before they walk out of the session. Begin each outcome with some variation of the words: “As a result of this session, you’ll be able to ...” Before Developing an Outcome Ask yourself: In a perfect world, what would the participants know by the end of my session? Brainstorm all potential items. Develop the Outcome Ask yourself: What are the essential “must-knows” from my list? (Other issues may fit into these broader categories.) How would I know that the participants know these things by the end of the training? What would I see or hear that would prove they know this? Then start the outcome statement with these words: “By the end of this session, participants will be able to ...” Then use an action word. (See next section.) Use the Outcome to Evaluate How Well They Got It At the end of the class, evaluate how successful you were in teaching your subject by asking: Can the participants prove that they know in a visible or audible way?',\n",

       "    'text': \"However, recently I've become convinced we are seeing a new paradigm emerge for note-taking and growing. Notes are becoming more and more public and less private so if I had to make one prediction regarding the big shifts happening, it’d be this:\\nI believe that taking notes publicly will replace private notes in the next 10 years, because of:\\n● Cultural shift. Only a few years ago it was awkward to put your name and your picture online. The culture is now shifting towards making notes more public.\\n● There’s a new category of tools that make public note-sharing easy. Some of these tools are Roam, Obsidian, TiddlyWiki, Notion.\\n● New monetization options are emerging and people are using them more and more to monetize their knowledge.\\nA digital garden, which is the topic of this model, is a public repository where you share your sawdust. Here’s what Maggie Appleton, who wrote about this model, said about digital gardens: “Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.”\\nSome of the benefits of a digital garden include:\\n● Your notes become assets ● Build your network. You can share it with others ● Traffic from search engines ● Forcing function for learning depth\",\n",

       "    'text': 'Benefits Of Being A Knowledge Entrepreneur\\n● Learn More. Most jobs have a learning plateau within months of taking on a new position. At first you learn a lot, but when you get the swing of things, you end up doing the same thing over and over. As a knowledge entrepreneur, you do the opposite. You maximize the time spent learning. Therefore, you build up your most valuable asset way more than typical approaches to entrepreneurship and typical jobs.\\n● Learn What You Want To Learn. As a knowledge entrepreneur you focus on learning what is most important and interesting to you rather than something you are forced to learn, which doesn’t really have any personal impact and won’t be valuable in other areas of your life.\\n● Embrace Your Inner Learner. The knowledge entrepreneur path allows you to embrace your love of learning, create life-transforming results in your own life and other people’s lives. Whereas, in many positions, one has to stifle their inner learner, focus on short-term deadlines, and do learning on the side as a hobby.\\n● Scalable. Selling ideas is the most scalable business in the world. Therefore, you can scale to millions of dollars in revenue while still doing what you love and not having to hire a huge team that you manage. As many entrepreneurs scale, they do what needs to be done to grow the business. This often means doing things that aren’t the most exciting for them on a day-to-day basis.\\n● Build Up Assets That Can Pay You Back For Decades. It’s exciting to have courses that could last for years or even decades and keep paying you.',\n",

Other forms of learning were a little suspect.\\nNow, college education is becoming suspect and online learning is appreciated.

We also use the same process to represent abstract things, like concepts and words. Finally, we shuffle those around in our brain, in order to conceptualize them as much as possible.\\n● Thought is simulating reality, so you don't just have to rely on lengthy and expensive trial and error.

In simple terms, if you've got a group that's working together, you may have noticed that there will typically be one or more people, within that group, who are really good at explaining how things work. Oftentimes, these very explainers are leaders. Of course, they may not be leaders in the animal sense, where they would be the first in the dominance hierarchy, but, in a lot of cases, they're really the intellectual or sometimes the cultural leaders.\\n● And then finally the leader is the definer of reality. Many years ago I read a book by Max Dupree about leadership that said: “The leader’s first job is to define reality.” I didn't know what that meant at the time, but after all these years I understand its value and meaning. If you think of yourself as a definer of reality, and you make that your very first priority, then you’ll go really far as a thought leader.\",\n",

Then others followed them into that space, and now we have whole groups of people, or cultures, or even the whole world that dwell in that thought space. It’s amazing that something like that is possible!\\nThe thought leader is someone who creates and is known for their ideas. If you want to know if someone's a thought leader, ask: Are they known for their ideas?\",\n",

       "    'text': \"The thought leader is an innovator and their innovation takes place in the world of ideas. It’s quite cool to think that being a thought leader sometimes means that you can just combine ideas from different places and then create new and valuable concepts and insights.\\nMoreover, the thought leader is also a mental model builder. In the work that we're doing here, in the Mental Model Club, as well as in the work we do for our own brands, we’re working on building models of reality, life, business, and relationships. We do that so we can think about these domains better, so we can then make better decisions, analyze situations, as well as interpret and understand better what things actually mean. By doing this, we feel that we can live more successful lives.\\nSo, you'll notice that the people who are considered thought leaders usually have mental models and oftentimes, they'll have a visuals that accompany those models Therefore, what you're trying to achieve as a thought leader is to build a model of how an area of reality works, and then transmit that model or install it in other people.\",\n",

Even the Bible describes, “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”60 Whoever you’re being, right now is the evidence of your Future Self. Your level of faith in and commitment toward your Future Self is evidenced by everything you do, and every thought you think.

       "    'text': 'While in the camps, Frankl could predict with extreme accuracy when a fellow inmate would die. Once purpose was extinguished in a fellow prisoner, Frankl watched as the glow of life left their eyes. No longer willing to share their small piece of daily bread, they disconnected from others, impulsively seeking short-term dopamine to numb themselves from the pain of the moment. The loss of purpose led to the death of the body. Without meaning in their suffering or hope to move forward, happiness was impossible. In the absence of purpose, the present experience became a prison to be escaped either by thoughts of the past, suicide, or another form of deterioration. Without a why to live for, every ounce of remaining life was used to escape the pain of the moment until they gasped for death like a drowning person gasps for air. In Man’s Search for Meaning, Frankl wrote: The prisoner who had lost faith in the future—his future—was doomed. With his loss of belief in the future, he also lost his spiritual hold; he let himself decline and became subject to mental and physical decay . . . Those who know how close the connection is between the state of mind of a man—his courage and hope, or lack of them—and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect',\n",

For Frankl, having a purpose wasn’t some vague hope or optimism, but a tangible and specific goal. In fact, he used the word goal most often to describe having a “meaning to fulfill” in your future. His description of having a purpose, meaning, or goal to accomplish squares exactly with modern research on the subject of hope. To the average person, hope may seem like mere wishing. But think for a minute what your life would be like without hope in the future. Without something specific to look and build toward, the present becomes utterly painful. In this frenetic nightmare, you feel there is no control or escape from a downward spiral. Without hope, motivation is impossible. You can’t be motivated toward action or outcome with zero hope in its possibility.',\n",

Low-hope people, on the other hand, stick with one approach and do not try other avenues when stymied. Instead of using problem-focused thought, the low-hope people often use counterproductive avoidance and disengagement thinking. Reinforced in the short term by their avoidance thoughts, low-hope people continue their passivity. Unfortunately, they do not learn from past experiences. High-hope people, however, use information about not reaching their goals as diagnostic feedback to search for other feasible approaches.16 High-hopers commit 100 percent to a specific result. While their goal is unwavering, they remain highly flexible in the process or path to achieve their pursuit.',\n",

Your goals become short term and avoidance-oriented, where you try escaping the pain of the present. When reactive, life happens to you, rather than for you. When reactive, you feel the victim to what life has done to you. Emotional health happens when you contain both a positive past and an exciting future. Having a positive past depends very little on what events actually occurred. What happened to you doesn’t matter as much as what story you decide to tell yourself about what happened. What happened to you doesn’t matter as much as what emotions you feel about what happened. Your past is fundamentally a meaning. The story you create about past events dictates what your past means to your present and to your Future Self. We get to choose what story we attach.

As psychologist Brent Slife states in Time and Psychological Explanation (italics mine): We reinterpret or reconstruct our memory in light of what our mental set is in the present. In this sense, it is more accurate to say the present causes the meaning of the past, than it is to say that the past causes the meaning of the present . . .

However, the researchers hadn’t given the students IQ tests at the beginning of the year. Instead, they randomized which students were considered gifted and which ones weren’t simply to see if it would influence their results.

Every single thing—food, clothing, electronics, homes and office buildings, cars and the fuel to run them, even this book you hold in your hands—is made from resources that come from the earth. Scientists who calculate the footprint of our species on the earth—the measure of resources we consume versus the capacity of the earth to replenish those resources—say that we passed the point of a sustainable balance about thirty years ago. We now take vastly more from the earth than she can regenerate. In financial terms, we’re living off an ecological credit card that we can never pay back. We are over our heads in ecological debt and we are passing that burden on to generations to come. We must find ways to replenish and conserve those resources, find a way to live within our ecological means, or we will go from crisis to deepening crisis in a downward spiral. The economic crisis is an accurate reflection of an ecological crisis, and we’ll never actually resolve it until we learn how to live within our ecological means.',\n",

It is a total fabrication of our genius. We made it up and we manufacture it. It is an inanimate object that has appeared in many different forms in its more than 2,500-to-3,500-year history, whether we’re talking about shells or stones or ingots of precious metals, a paper bill or a blip on the computer screen. From the very beginning, money was invented to facilitate the sharing and exchanging of goods and services among individuals and groups of people. Money still facilitates the sharing and exchange of goods and services, but somewhere along the way the power we gave money outstripped its original utilitarian role. Now, rather than relating to money as a tool we created and control, we have come to relate to money as if it is a fact of nature, a force to be reckoned with. This stuff called money, mass-produced tokens or paper bills with no more inherent power than a notepad or a Kleenex, has become the single most controlling force in our lives. Money has only the power that we assign to it, and we have assigned it immense power. We have given it almost final authority. If we look only at behavior, it tells us that we have made money more important than we are, given it more meaning than human life.',\n",

We really do want a world that works for everyone. We don’t want children to go hungry. We don’t want violence and war to plague the planet anywhere, even if it’s a distant place. We don’t want torture and revenge and retribution to be instruments of government and leadership. Everyone wants a safe, secure, loving, nourishing life for themselves and the ones they love and really for everyone. We all want a healthy planet, and an opportunity for everyone to have a chance of a healthy, productive life. I also believe that under their fears and upsets, even the deepest ones, everyone wants to love and be loved, and make a difference with their lives. Speaking in spiritual terms, and not a specific religious sense, I believe people also want an experience of their own divinity, their own connectedness with all life and the mystery of something greater than we comprehend. The money culture has shaped us in many ways that we would not choose in a more conscious soulful process, driving us such that we unwittingly undermine and erode those most deeply human values and highest commitments, and at times turn away from the very ones we profess to hold dear.',\n",

We are thoughtful and generous, allowing, courageous, and committed. We recognize the value of love and friendship. We admire a small thing well done. We experience moments of awe in the presence of nature and its unrefined beauty. We are open, vulnerable, and heartful. We have the capacity to be moved, and generosity is natural. We are trustworthy and trusting of others, and our self-expression flourishes. We feel at peace within ourselves and confidant that we are an integral part of a larger, more universal experience, something greater than ourselves. When we enter the domain of money, there often seems to be a disconnect from the soulful person we have known ourselves to be. It is as if we are suddenly transported to a different playing field where all the rules have changed. In the grip of money, those wonderful qualities of soul seem to be less available. We become smaller. We scramble or race to “get what’s ours.” We often grow selfish, greedy, petty, fearful, or controlling, or sometimes confused, conflicted, or guilty. We see ourselves as winners or losers, powerful or helpless, and we let those labels deeply define us in ways that are inaccurate, as if financial wealth and control indicate innate superiority, and lack of them suggests a lack of worth or basic human potential. Visions of possibility dissolve. We become wary and mistrusting, protective of our little piece, or helpless and hopeless. We sometimes feel driven to behave in ways inconsistent with our core values, and unable to act differently.',\n",

The vicious cycle of poverty, she said, has been clearly articulated and is widely known. What is less obvious and goes almost completely unacknowledged is the vicious cycle of wealth. There is no recognition of the trap that wealth so often is, and of the suffering of the wealthy: the loneliness, the isolation, the hardening of the heart, the hunger and poverty of the soul that can come with the burden of wealth. She said that I had extended little or no compassion to the strong, the powerful, and the wealthy, while they need as much compassion as anyone else on earth. “You must open your heart to them and become their student and their teacher,” she said in her letter. “Open your compassion and include them. This is an important part of your life’s work. Do not shut them out. They also are your work.” This was a shocking idea to me. Of course the rich were human and had their woes, but I had never thought of them as needy. I could begin to see it now. Their money bought them material comforts and some level of protection from the inconveniences and impositions of more ordinary everyday life. But their money and the lifestyle of privilege also cut them off from the richness of ordinary everyday life, the more normal and healthy give-and-take of relationships and useful work, the best of the human experience.

       "    'text': 'Contemporary European author, Bernard Lietaer, former senior officer of the Belgian Central Bank and one of the chief architects of the Euro currency, in his book, Of Human Wealth, says that greed and fear of scarcity are programmed; they do not exist in nature, not even in human nature. They are built into the money system in which we swim, and we’ve been swimming in it so long that these shadows have become almost completely transparent to us. We have learned to consider them normal and legitimate behavior. He concludes that Adam Smith’s system of economics could more accurately be described as the allocation of scarce resources through the process of individual greed. The whole process of Smith’s “modern” economics actually has its roots in primitive fears of scarcity, greed, and the implementation tool—the process by which this became real—was money. When we step out of the shadow of this distorted and outdated system and the mind-set it generates, what we discover is this: Scarcity is a lie. Independent of any actual amount of resources, it is an unexamined and false system of assumptions, opinions, and beliefs from which we view the world as a place where we are in constant danger of having our needs unmet.',\n",

What I have found is that no matter where we are in the political, economic, or financial resource spectrum, the myths and mind-set of scarcity create an underlying fear that we, and the people we love or care about, won’t have enough of what’s needed to have a satisfying, happy, productive, or even survivable life. This mind-set of scarcity is not something we intentionally created or have any conscious intention to bring into our life.

There’s not enough generates a fear that drives us to make sure that we’re not the person, or our loved ones aren’t the people, who get crushed, marginalized, or left out.

It’s the logical response if you fear there’s not enough, but more is better drives a competitive culture of accumulation, acquisition, and greed that only heightens fears and quickens the pace of the race. And none of it makes life more valuable. In truth, the rush for more distances us from experiencing the deeper value of what we acquire or already have. When we eat too fast or too much, we cannot savor any single bite of food. When we are focused constantly on the next thing—the next dress, the next car, the next job, the next vacation, the next home improvement—we hardly experience the gifts of that which we have now. In our relationship with money, more is better distracts us from living more mindfully and richly with what we have. More is better is a chase with no end and a race without winners.

Perhaps it had been a valid perception at one time, or perhaps it hadn’t been, he said, but at this point in history—in the 1970s—we were able to do so much more with so much less that as a human family we clearly had reached a point where there actually was enough for everyone everywhere to meet or even surpass their needs to live a reasonably healthy, productive life. This moment represented a dramatic breakthrough in the evolution of civilization and humankind, he said. Whether it was a recognition of something already true or a moment of transformation in the status of civilizations, he said, either way it could be the most significant turning point in our evolution because it meant we could move from a you-or-me world—a world where either you or I make it, and where we need to compete and fight to see who wins—to a you-and-me world, where all of us can make it. In that you-and-me world, all of us have enough food, enough water, enough land, enough housing, enough of the fundamental things for each one of us to live a fulfilling and productive life. This new threshold completely changes the game, and it would take fifty years, he predicted, for us to make the necessary adjustments in our world so we could move from a you-or-me paradigm to you-and-me paradigm, a paradigm that says the world can work for everyone with no one and nothing left out. He said that our money system, our financial resources system, would need to adjust itself to reflect that reality and it would take decades for us to make that adjustment, but if and when we did, we would enter an age, a time, and a world in which the very fundamental ways we perceive and think about ourselves and the world we live in would be so transformed that it would be unrecognizable.',\n",

We rationalize that someone is destined to end up with the short end of the stick. When we believe that more is better, and equate having more with being more—more smart or more able—then people on the short end of that resource stick are assumed to be less smart, less able, even less valuable, as human beings. We feel we have permission to discount them. When we believe that’s just the way things are, then we assume a posture of helplessness. We believe that a problem is unsolvable. We accept that in our human family neither the resource-rich members nor the resource-poor members have enough money, enough food, or enough intelligence or resourcefulness to generate lasting solutions.',\n",

In the rain forest with the Achuar, I saw a people who were naturally prosperous. They hadn’t won some competitive economic game to be prosperous. They were not prosperous at anyone’s expense. They hadn’t beaten anyone at anything. They were prosperous in the way they were with themselves and one another, living consistent with the true laws, the unchanging laws of the natural world, which ultimately govern us all. Theirs was a culture with no money in it. It was something they encountered primarily when they ventured out of the forest. It was, for them, an odd, adjunct thing that was not a part of their everyday life or even their consciousness. With no money, no ownership, no accumulation of goods, and none of the conveniences of our Western lifestyle, still there was no suggestion of scarcity; no lack and no fear that there wouldn’t be enough of what they needed. There was no chase for more, and no resignation or belief that they were living lives of less-than. They lived (and still do) in the experience and expression of enough, or what I call sufficiency. Instead of seeking more, they treasure and steward thoughtfully what is already there. In fact, their efforts today are devoted to protecting what is there—the rain forest—as a resource for all of us. For the Achuar, wealth means being present to the fullness and richness of the moment and sharing that with one another.',\n",

By sufficiency, I don’t mean a quantity of anything. Sufficiency isn’t two steps up from poverty or one step short of abundance. It isn’t a measure of barely enough or more than enough. Sufficiency isn’t an amount at all. It is an experience, a context we generate, a declaration, a knowing that there is enough, and that we are enough. Sufficiency resides inside of each of us, and we can call it forward. It is a consciousness, an attention, an intentional choosing of the way we think about our circumstances. In our relationship with money, it is using money in a way that expresses our integrity; using it in a way that expresses value rather than determines value. Sufficiency is not a message about simplicity or about cutting back and lowering expectations. Sufficiency doesn’t mean we shouldn’t strive or aspire. Sufficiency is an act of generating, distinguishing, making known to ourselves the power and presence of our existing resources, and our inner resources. Sufficiency is a context we bring forth from within that reminds us that if we look around us and within ourselves, we will find what we need. There is always enough.',\n",

In the context of sufficiency, and the flow of resources to and through and from us, our soul and money interests merge to create a rich, satisfying, and meaningful life. Sufficiency is the truth.

We can rediscover fulfillment and satisfaction. The greatest teacher of sufficiency is nature and the natural laws of the earth—laws that have no amendments, laws that are not argued on the Senate floor. These are the laws we live by whether we acknowledge them or not. The great environmentalist Dana Meadows said that one of the most fundamental laws of the earth is the law of enough. Nature, she once wrote, says we have “just so much and no more. Just so much soil. Just so much water. Just so much sunshine. Everything born of the earth grows to its appropriate size and then stops. The planet does not get bigger, it gets better. Its creatures learn, mature, diversify, evolve, create amazing beauty and novelty and complexity, but live within absolute limits.” Nature’s examples are everywhere around us, available at any moment to teach us what we need to learn to have a breakthrough in our relationship with life so that it is sustainable. This distinction of sufficiency allows us to transform our unsustainable culture to a sustainable one. Can we individually and collectively in our relationship with money and all resources shift from the assumption that more, no matter what, is better? Can we recognize that better comes from not more, but in deepening our experience of what’s already there? Rather than growth being external in acquiring and accumulating money or things, can we redefine growth to see it as a recognition of and appreciation for what we already have?',\n",

So often we think of “abundance” as the point at which we’ll know we’ve really arrived, but abundance continues to be elusive if we think we’ll find it in some excessive amount of something. True abundance does exist; it flows from sufficiency, in an experience of the beauty and wholeness of what is. Abundance is a fact of nature. It is a fundamental law of nature, that there is enough and it is finite. Its finiteness is no threat; it creates a more accurate relationship that commands respect, reverence, and managing those resources with the knowledge that they are precious and in ways that do the most good for the most people. I can see in the environmental movement that the quest for sustainability may be more accurately located in recognizing and affirming that we do have what we need—not that it’s disappearing and that we have to save it because it’s diminishing, but that we have what we need, exactly what we need, and therefore we must make a difference with it. We must know that it is a finite and precious resource, but it is enough. This way of seeing, which is consistent with the laws of the natural world, offers a new set of principles or set of assumptions for a whole new culture around money. It teaches us how to be stewards of money rather than gatherers of money. It teaches us how to bring quality and intelligence to our use of financial resources in ways that reflect our inner wealth rather than the flamboyant display of the accumulation of outer riches.',\n",

They broke texts into fragments and assembled them into new patterns by transcribing them in different sections of their notebooks. Then they reread the copies and rearranged the patterns while adding more excerpts. Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality.III Commonplace books were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from different sources and to inspire their own thinking.',\n",

It is a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your changing needs over time. In school or courses you take, it can be used to take notes for studying. At work, it can help you organize your projects. At home, it can help you manage your household. However you decide to use it, your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solitude before sharing it with others.',\n",

One searchable, always accessible, easily shared and embedded amongst the digital text we consume.”6 This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas. It is a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your changing needs over time. In school or courses you take, it can be used to take notes for studying. At work, it can help you organize your projects. At home, it can help you manage your household. However you decide to use it, your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solitude before sharing it with others.',\n",

It also tells us that we don’t need to consume or understand all of it, or even much of it. All we need is a few seeds of wisdom, and the seeds we most need tend to continually find us again and again. You don’t need to go out and hunt down insights.

       "    'text': 'Measuring Output Andy Grove’s quantum leap was to apply manufacturing production principles to the “soft professions,” the administrative, professional, and managerial ranks. He sought to “create an environment that values and emphasizes output” and to avoid what Drucker termed the “activity trap”: “[S]tressing output is the key to increasing productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite.” On an assembly line, it’s easy enough to distinguish output from activity. It gets trickier when employees are paid to think. Grove wrestled with two riddles: How can we define and measure output by knowledge workers? And what can be done to increase it? Grove was a scientific manager. He read everything in the budding fields of behavioral science and cognitive psychology. While the latest theories offered “a nicer way to get people to work” than in Henry Ford’s heyday, controlled university experiments “simply would not show that one style of leadership was better than another. It was hard to escape the conclusion that no optimal management style existed.” At Intel, Andy recruited “aggressive introverts” in his own image, people who solved problems quickly, objectively, systematically, and permanently. Following his lead, they were skilled at confronting a problem without attacking the person. They set politics aside to make faster, sounder, more collective decisions.',\n",

Clear-cut time frames intensify our focus and commitment; nothing moves us forward like a deadline. To win in the global marketplace, organizations need to be more nimble than ever before. In my experience, a quarterly OKR cadence is best suited to keep pace with today’s fast-changing markets. A three-month horizon curbs procrastination and leads to real performance gains. In High Output Management, his leadership bible, Andy Grove notes: For the feedback to be effective, it must be received very soon after the activity it is measuring occurs. Accordingly, an [OKR] system should set objectives for a relatively short period. For example, if we plan on a yearly basis, the corresponding [OKR] time should be at least as often as quarterly or perhaps even monthly.',\n",

Once contributors have consulted with their managers and committed to their OKRs for the quarter, any add-on objectives or key results must fit into the established agenda. How does the new goal stack up against my existing ones? Should something be dropped to make room for the new commitment? In a high-functioning OKR system, top-down mandates to “just do more” are obsolete. Orders give way to questions, and to one question in particular: What matters most? When it came to goal setting, Andy Grove felt strongly that less is more: The one thing an [OKR] system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. Each time you make a commitment, you forfeit your chance to commit to something else. This, of course, is an inevitable, inescapable consequence of allocating any finite resource. People who plan have to have the guts, honesty, and discipline to drop projects as well as to initiate them, to shake their heads “no” as well as to smile “yes.”\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. We must realize—and act on the realization—that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. Above all, top-line objectives must be significant. OKRs are neither a catchall wish list nor the sum of a team’s mundane tasks. They’re a set of stringently curated goals that merit special attention and will move people forward in the here and now. They link to the larger purpose we’re expected to deliver around. “The art of management,” Grove wrote, “lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them.” Or as Larry Page would say, winning organizations need to “put more wood behind fewer arrows.” That, in very few and focused words, is the essence of our first superpower.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Midlife Tracking As the Fitbit craze attests, people crave to know how they’re progressing and see it visually represented, down to the percentage point. Research suggests that making measured headway can be more incentivizing than public recognition, monetary inducements, or even achieving the goal itself. Daniel Pink, the author of Drive, agrees: “The single greatest motivator is ‘making progress in one’s work.’ The days that people make progress are the days they feel most motivated and engaged.” Most goal management platforms use visual aids to show progress toward objectives and key results. Unlike steps on Fitbit, OKRs don’t require daily tracking. But regular check-ins—preferably weekly—are essential to prevent slippage. As Peter Drucker observed, “Without an action plan, the executive becomes a prisoner of events. And without check-ins to reexamine the plan as events unfold, the executive has no way of knowing which events really matter and which are only noise.” As noted in chapter 4, the simple act of writing down a goal increases your chances of reaching it. Your odds are better still if you monitor progress while sharing the goal with colleagues—two integral OKR features. In one California study, people who recorded their goals and sent weekly progress reports to a friend attained 43 percent more of their objectives than those who merely thought about goals without sharing them.',\n",

Update: Modify a yellow zone (“needs attention”) key result or objective to respond to changes in the workflow or external environment. What could be done differently to get the goal on track? Does it need a revised time line? Do we back-burner other initiatives to free up resources for this one? Start: Launch a new OKR mid-cycle, whenever the need arises. Stop: When a red zone (“at risk”) goal has outlived its usefulness, the best solution may be to drop it.* The point of a real-time dashboard is to quantify progress against a target and flag what needs attention.

In my view, the key to satisfaction is to set aggressive goals, achieve most of them, pause to reflect on the achievement, and then repeat the cycle. Learning “from direct experience,” a Harvard Business School study found, “can be more effective if coupled with reflection—that is, the intentional attempt to synthesize, abstract, and articulate the key lessons taught by experience.” The philosopher and educator John Dewey went a step further: “We do not learn from experience\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. we learn from reflecting on experience.” Here are some reflections for closing out an OKR cycle: Did I accomplish all of my objectives? If so, what contributed to my success? If not, what obstacles did I encounter? If I were to rewrite a goal achieved in full, what would I change? What have I learned that might alter my approach to the next cycle’s OKRs? OKR wrap-ups are retrospective and forward-looking at the same time. An unfinished objective might be rolled over to the next quarter, with a fresh set of key results—or perhaps its moment has passed, and it is appropriately dropped.

Like the 1960s NASA moon mission, a BHAG captures the imagination and grabs people in the gut.

The arenas ranged widely, but the results were “unequivocal,” Locke wrote. “[T]he harder the goal the higher the level of performance.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.

       "    'text': 'Aspirational goals draw on every OKR superpower. Focus and commitment are a must for targeting goals that make a real difference. Only a transparent, collaborative, aligned, and connected organization can achieve so far beyond the norm. And without quantifiable tracking, how can you know when you’ve reached that amazing stretch objective? Two OKR Baskets Google divides its OKRs into two categories, committed goals and aspirational (or “stretch”) goals. It’s a distinction with a real difference. Committed objectives are tied to Google’s metrics: product releases, bookings, hiring, customers. Management sets them at the company level, employees at the departmental level. In general, these committed objectives—such as sales and revenue goals—are to be achieved in full (100 percent) within a set time frame. Aspirational objectives reflect bigger-picture, higher-risk, more future-tilting ideas. They originate from any tier and aim to mobilize the entire organization. By definition, they are challenging to achieve. Failures—at an average rate of 40 percent—are part of Google’s territory. The relative weighting of these two baskets is a cultural question. It will vary from one organization to the next, and from quarter to quarter. Leaders must ask themselves: What type of company do we need to be in the coming year? Agile and daring, to crack a new market—or more conservative and operational, to firm up our existing position? Are we in survival mode, or is there cash on hand to bet big for a big reward? What does our business require, right now?',\n",

Most people, Larry Page observes, “tend to assume that things are impossible, rather than starting from real-world physics and figuring out what’s actually possible.” In Wired, Steven Levy elaborated: The way Page sees it, a ten percent improvement means that you’re doing the same thing as everybody else. You probably won’t fail spectacularly, but you are guaranteed not to succeed wildly. That’s why Page expects Googlers to create products and services that are ten times better than the competition. That means he isn’t satisfied with discovering a couple of hidden efficiencies or tweaking code to achieve modest gains. Thousand percent improvement requires rethinking problems, exploring what’s technically possible and having fun in the process.',\n",

       "    'text': 'OKRs may be called a tool, or a protocol, or a process. But my image of choice is a launch pad, a point of liftoff for the next wave of entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs. My dream is to see Andy Grove’s brainchild transform every walk of life. I believe it can have a huge impact on GDP growth, health care outcomes, school success, government performance, business results, and social progress. We’re getting glimpses of that future through forward thinkers like Orly Friedman, who has introduced OKRs to every elementary schoolchild at the Khan Lab School in Mountain View, California. (Imagine you are five or six years old and setting your own goals for learning—your own objectives and key results!—as you learn to reason and read.) I’m convinced that if structured goal setting and continuous communication were to be widely deployed, with rigor and imagination, we could see exponentially greater productivity and innovation throughout society. OKRs have such enormous potential because they are so adaptable. There is no dogma, no one right way to use them. Different organizations have fluctuating needs at various phases of their life cycle. For some, the simple act of making goals open and transparent is a big leap forward. For others, a quarterly planning cadence will change the game. It’s up to you to find your points of emphasis and to make the tool your own. This book tells a handful of behind-the-scenes stories of OKRs and CFRs. Thousands more are just getting started or have yet to be told. Moving forward, we’re going to continue this conversation at whatmatters.com. Come see us there. And you can join the discussion by emailing me at john@whatmatters.com. My ultimate stretch OKR is to empower people to achieve the seemingly impossible together. To create durable cultures for success and significance. And to prime the pump of inspiration for all the goals—especially your goals—that matter most.',\n",

By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational. When properly designed and deployed, they’re a vaccine against fuzzy thinking—and fuzzy execution. KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable. (As prize pupil Marissa Mayer would say, “It’s not a key result unless it has a number.”) You either meet a key result’s requirements or you don’t; there is no gray area, no room for doubt. At the end of the designated period, typically a quarter, we declare the key result fulfilled or not. Where an objective can be long-lived, rolled over for a year or longer, key results evolve as the work progresses. Once they are all completed, the objective is necessarily achieved.

A corporation, he wrote, should be a community “built on trust and respect for the workers—not just a profit machine.” Further, he urged that subordinates be consulted on company goals. Instead of traditional crisis management, he proposed a balance of long- and short-range planning, informed by data and enriched by regular conversations among colleagues. Drucker aimed to map out “a principle of management that will give full scope to individual strength and responsibility and at the same time give common direction of vision and effort, establish team work and harmonize the goals of the individual with the common weal.” He discerned a basic truth of human nature: When people help choose a course of action, they are more likely to see it through. In 1954, in his landmark book The Practice of Management, Drucker codified this principle as “management by objectives and self-control.” It became Andy Grove’s foundation and the genesis of what we now call the OKR.',\n",

I’m pretty sure my answer will surprise you, but once you realize that creating a habit is a skill, my answer will make perfect sense. Ready? To wire in a habit fast or help yourself remember, you need to rehearse the behavior sequence (the Anchor, then the new habit) and immediately celebrate. Repeat this sequence seven to ten times. By doing this drill — by rehearsing — you are supercharging the speed of habit formation. I know this sounds crazy today, but I believe this technique will be common practice in the future. When you rehearse your habit, you are training for the very moment you will do the habit in real life, just as you would rehearse for a dance recital or sales pitch. If you didn’t rehearse for these things, your dance performance would suffer and your sales pitch might fail. When it comes to peak performance, rehearsal matters.',\n",

       "    'text': 'So how do you pick the right market? What To Look For There is a market in desperate need of your abilities. You need to find it. And when you do, you will capitalize, all while wondering what took you so long. Don’t be romantic about your audience. Serve the people who can pay you what you’re worth. And remember that picking a market, like anything, is always our choice, so choose wisely. In order to sell anything, you need demand. We are not trying to create demand. We are trying to channel it. That is a very important distinction. If you don’t have a market for your offer, nothing that follows will work. This entire book sits atop the assumption that you have at least a “normal” market, which I define as a market that is growing at the same rate as the marketplace and that has common unmet needs that fall into one of three categories: improved health, increased wealth, or improved relationships.',\n",

Given a 10 percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you\\'re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten . . . We all know that if you swing for the fences, you\\'re going to strike out a lot, but you\\'re also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it\\'s important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.\" Jeff Bezos',\n",

If you want to grow, you’ve got to either sell more clients every month (while maintaining suitable margins) or have them be worth more (by increasing the profit per purchase or number of times they buy). That’s it. Author Note - Only Two Ways to Grow To simplify this concept even more. There are really only two ways to grow: get more customers, and increase each customer’s value. “Increasing each customer’s value” has two sub-buckets: 1) Increasing profit per purchase 2) Increasing the number of times they buy. For the purpose of this book, I highlight both of those sub-buckets as individual growth paths. I did this because I think it will be easier to understand the money models that will come in Volume III. All three — getting more customers, increasing their average purchase value, and getting them to buy more — are repeated themes in this book. But if you seek simplicity, both increasing average purchase value and increasing the number of times a customer buys results in one outcome: increasing each customer’s value.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Value-Driven vs. Price-Driven Purchases This book was intended to be a textbook for any business that wants to grow. I’ve spent (and continue to spend) hundreds of hours on calls and in-person meetings consulting entrepreneurs on crafting their offers. I have seen the ones that take off into the stratosphere and those that fizzle. Having a Grand Slam offer makes it almost impossible to lose. But why? What gives it such an impact? In short, having a Grand Slam Offer helps with all three of the requirements for growth: getting more customers, getting them to pay more, and getting them to do so more times. How? It allows you to differentiate yourself from the marketplace. In other words, it allows you to sell your product based on VALUE not on PRICE. Commoditized = Price Driven Purchases (race to the bottom) Differentiated = Value Driven Purchases (sell in a category of one with no comparison. Yes, market matters, which I will expound on in the next chapter) A commodity, as I define it, is a product available from many places. For that reason, it’s prone to purchases based on “price” instead of “value.” If all products are “equal,” then the cheapest one is the most valuable by default. In other words, if a prospect compares your product to another and thinks “these are pretty much the same, I’ll buy the cheaper one,” then they commoditized you. How embarrassing! But really . . . it’s one of the worst experiences a value-driven entrepreneur can have. This is a massive problem for the entrepreneur because commodities are valued at the point of market efficiency. This means that the marketplace drives the price down through competition until the margins are just enough to keep the lights on: “just enough” to become a slave to their business.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Alright, let’s start by defining a Grand Slam Offer. It’s an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers . . . forever removing the cash constraint on business growth. In other words, it allows you to sell in a “category of one,” or, to apply another great phrase, to “sell in a vacuum.” The resulting purchasing decision for the prospect is now between your product and nothing. So you can sell at whatever price you get the prospect to perceive, not in comparison to anything else. As a result, it gets you more customers, at higher ticket prices, for less money. If you like fancy marketing terms, it breaks down like this: Increased Response Rates (think clicks) Increased Conversion (think sales) Premium Prices (think charging a lot of money). Having a Grand Slam Offer increases your response rates to advertisements (aka more people will click or take an action on an advertisement they see containing a Grand Slam Offer). If you pay the same amount for eyeballs but 1) more people respond, 2) more of those responses buy, and 3) they buy for higher prices, your business grows.',\n",

If the client sees a cheaper version of the “same thing,” then the value discrepancy will cause them to swap providers. This is a dilemma . . . lose this client, the rest of your clients, and potential clients, or stay “competitive.” Your margins become so thin they vanish. Furthermore, it’s hard to get prospects to say yes (and keep them saying yes) unless you’re hypervigilant about clients commoditizing your business by staying “competitive.” And that’s the problem with the old commoditized way. They’re able to compare. Unless you switch to a Grand Slam Offer, your prices will keep getting beaten down. The business eventually dies, or the entrepreneur throws in the towel. No bueno. We want to make an offer that’s so different that you can skip the awkward explanation of why your product is different from everyone elses (which, if they have to ask, then they are probably too ignorant to understand the explanation) and instead just have the offer do that work for you.

But we can all be blinded as entrepreneurs because we don't like to give up. We are so accustomed to solving impossible problems that we will keep ramming our heads into the wall. We hate quitting. But the reality is that everyone is affected by their market. So how do you pick the right market? What To Look For There is a market in desperate need of your abilities. You need to find it. And when you do, you will capitalize, all while wondering what took you so long. Don’t be romantic about your audience. Serve the people who can pay you what you’re worth. And remember that picking a market, like anything, is always our choice, so choose wisely. In order to sell anything, you need demand. We are not trying to create demand. We are trying to channel it. That is a very important distinction. If you don’t have a market for your offer, nothing that follows will work. This entire book sits atop the assumption that you have at least a “normal” market, which I define as a market that is growing at the same rate as the marketplace and that has common unmet needs that fall into one of three categories: improved health, increased wealth, or improved relationships.\",\n",

So for us entrepreneurs, endless opportunity abounds. The degree of the pain will be proportional to the price you will be able to charge (more on this in the Value Equation chapter). When they hear the solution to their pain, and inversely, what their life would look like without this pain, they should be drawn to your solution.

       "    'text': \"Commit to the Niche I have a saying when coaching entrepreneurs on picking their target market “Don’t make me niche slap you.” Too often, a newer entrepreneur half-heartedly tries one offer in one market, doesn't make a million dollars, then mistakenly thinks “this is a bad market.” Most times that’s not actually the case. They just haven’t found a Grand Slam Offer yet to apply to that market. They think, I’ll switch from helping dentists to helping chiropractors — that’s it! When, in reality, both of those are normal markets and represent billions of dollars in revenue. Either would work, just not both. You must pick one. No one can serve two masters. I have coined the term “niche slap” to remind entrepreneurs in my communities to commit once they pick. All businesses and, all markets, have unpleasant characteristics. The grass is never greener once you get to the other side. If you keep hopping from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be niche slapped. You must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error. You will fail. In fact, you will fail until you succeed. But you will fail far longer if you keep changing who you market to, because you must start over from the beginning each time. So, pick then commit. Riches Are In The Niches The other reason to commit to the niche is because of how much more you will make. Simply put, niching down will make you far more money.\",\n",

It was what took me from doing acquisition for anyone to teaching it to a specific avatar. In my instance, I decided on a microgym owner with ~100 members, a signed lease, at least one employee, and wanted to help clients lose weight. That’s pretty specific compared to “small business owners” or “anyone who will pay me” which is common. And I was very specific. In that business (Gym Launch) - we turned down - and still do - anyone who is not that avatar. That means no personal trainers, no online coaches, etc. Could I have helped them? Of course I could have. I mean heck, the majority of our portfolio is comprised of non-gym companies. But in order to maintain product focus, and high converting messaging, knowing exactly who the product was for was a game changer. It helped us know exactly who we were speaking to at all times. And exactly whose problems we were solving. But simplicity and ease may not be enough to sway you, so let me illustrate why honing in on one niche will make you more money. Reason: you can literally charge 100x more for the exact same product. Dan Kennedy was the first person to illustrate this for me, and I will do my best to pass on the torch to you in these pages.',\n",

Unless you were some massive time management guru with a compelling or unique story, it would be unlikely it would turn into anything significant. What do you think “yet another” time management course is valued at? $19, $29? Sure. Nothing to write home about. Let’s just say $19 for illustration sake. **Now we shall unleash the power of niche pricing in various stages on your product** So let’s imagine you make the product more specific, keeping the same principles, and call it “Time Management For Sales Professionals.” All of a sudden, this course is for a more specific type of person. We could tie their increase to even one more sale or one more deal and it would be worth more. But there are a lot of sales people. So this might be a $99 product. Neat, but we can do better. So let’s go down another level of niching and call our product…. “Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps.” Following the same principles of specificity, now we know our sales people probably have very experienced deals and commissions. A single sale would easily net this salesman $500 (or more), so it would be easy to justify a $499 price tag. This is already a 25x increase in price for almost an identical product. I could stop here, but I’m going to go one step further. Let’s just niche down one last level…. “Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools & Gardening Sales Reps.” Boom. Think about it for a second, if you were a power tools outbound sales rep, you would think to yourself “This is made exactly for me” and would happily fork over maybe $1000 to $2000 for a time management program that could help you achieve your goal.',\n",

Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out. If you try one hundred offers, I promise you will succeed. Most people never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It takes resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It’s not about you! If your offer doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean you suck. It means your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try again. You’ll never become world class if you stop after a failed attempt. If you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you’ll likely never need to work again (seriously).

They believe what they are getting (VALUE) is worth more than what they are giving in exchange for it (PRICE). The moment the value they receive dips below what they are paying, they stop buying from you. This price to value discrepancy is what you need to avoid at all costs. After all, as Warren Buffet said, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” The simplest way to increase the gap between price to value is by lowering the price. It’s also, most of the time, the wrong decision for the business. Getting people to buy is NOT the objective of a business. Making money is. And lowering price is a one-way road to destruction for most — you can only go down to $0, but you can go infinitely high in the other direction. So, unless you have a revolutionary way of decreasing your costs to 1/10th compared to your competition, don't compete on price.

This allows you to ultimately enjoy the process for the long haul and help more people as you grow, rather than burning out and shriveling into obscurity. To swing the argument even further in favor of higher prices, here are a few interesting concepts. When you raise your price, you increase the value the consumer receives without changing anything else about your product. Wait, what? Yes. Higher Price Means Higher Value (Literally) In a blind taste test, researchers asked consumers to rate three wines: a low-priced wine, a medium-priced wine and an expensive wine. Throughout the study, the participants rated the wines with the prices visible. They rated them, unsurprisingly, in order of their price, with the most expensive being the “best,” the second most expensive being “second best,” and the third, cheapest option, being rated as “cheap wine.” What the tasters didn’t know is that the researchers gave them the exact same wine all three times. Yet, the tasters reported a wide discrepancy between the “high priced” wine and the “cheap” wine. This has deep implications for the direct relationship between value and price. In essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. What’s more, the higher the price, the more allure your product or service has. People want to buy expensive things. They just need a reason. And the goal isn’t just to be slightly above the market price — the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, “This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.” That is how you create a category…',\n",

       "    'text': 'Summary Points What should you take from this? First and foremost, charge a premium. It will allow you to do things no one else can to make your clients successful. We were able to charge a premium because we provided more value than anyone else in the industry. In a real way, we were charging on a fraction of what our clients made using our system. This is important. Our clients still got a deal. The gap between what they paid (price) and what they got (value) was massive. As a result, the virtuous cycle continued to spin. We charged the most money. We provided the most value. Our gyms remained the most competitive, made the most money, always had the latest and best acquisition systems, and had the support to implement them at lightning speed. We made many mistakes along the way, but our pricing model was not one of them. It allowed me the room to make big bets without losing the farm. The truth is that 99 percent of businesses need to raise their prices to grow, not lower them. Profit is oxygen. It fuels the fire of growth. You need it if you want to reach more people and make a bigger impact.',\n",

That being said, anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can charge these rates and get people to say yes. From this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about “what's fair.” Every enormous company in the world charges you money for things that cost them nothing. It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except they don’t mind charging you hundreds per month for access. It costs pennies to manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, but they don’t mind charging hundreds of dollars a month for it. Media companies charge advertisers a king’s ransom for your eyeballs, and it costs them next to nothing to get you to like kitten photos on social media. You need to have a big discrepancy between what something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful. Many entrepreneurs believe that charging “too much” is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than your product is worth. But you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a hundred times more, not just two or three times more. And if you provide enough value, it should still always be a steal for the prospect. That is the power of value. It unleashes unlimited pricing and profit power to scale your company.\",\n",

       "    'text': \"Get The Bottom To Zero In the beginning of my career, I focused all my attention on dream outcomes and the perception of achievement (social proof, third-party edification, etc). In other words, the top side of the equation. That’s where beginner marketers make bigger and bigger claims. It’s easy, and it’s lazy. But as time has gone on, I have realized that these larger-than-life claims are the easiest to establish (and therefore less unique). After all, anyone can make a promise. The harder, and more competitive, are the Time Delay and Effort & Sacrifice. The best companies in the world focus all their attention on the bottom side of the equation. Making things immediate, seamless, and effortless. Apple made the iPhone effortless compared to other phones at the time. Amazon made purchasing a single click of a button and made purchases arrive almost immediately (maybe by the time you read this, they’ll be sending drones to our doors within 60 minutes). Netflix made consuming television immediate and effortless. So, the older I get, the more I have shifted my focus to “the hard stuff” — decreasing the bottom side of the equation. And I believe the better you do this, the more you will be rewarded by the marketplace. Final note: The reason this is a division equation and not an addition (“+”) is that I wanted to convey one key point. If you can make the bottom part of the equation equal to zero, you’re golden. No matter how small the top side is, anything divided by zero equals infinity (which is technically undefined for the math nerds). In other words, if you can reduce your prospects' true time delay to receiving value to zero (aka you realize your immediate dream outcome), and your effort and sacrifice is zero, you have an infinitely valuable product. If you accomplish this, you win the game. Given this postulate, a prospect would (in theory) purchase something from you, and the moment their credit card was run, it would immediately become their reality. That is infinite value.\",\n",

       "    'text': 'Perception is Reality Perception is reality. It’s not about how much you increase your prospect’s likelihood of success, or decrease the time delay to achievement, or decrease their effort and sacrifice. That in itself is not valuable. Many times, they will have no idea. The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice. A prime example of this happened in the London tunnel system. The biggest increase in rider satisfaction (aka value) was never from faster trains to decrease wait times. Instead, it was from a simple dotted map that showed them when the next train was coming and how long they had to wait. The dotted map, which only cost a few million dollars, decreased the riders’ perception of time delay and sacrifice (being bored waiting) more than actually making the trains faster (which costs billions of dollars to do). Isn’t that cool? This is how we need to think about our products. Pro Tip: Logical vs Psychological Solutions Most people naturally try and solve problems using logical solutions. But the logical solutions have usually been tried...because they’re logical (it’s what everyone would try and do). As a business owners and entrepreneurs I increasingly approach problems to find psychological solutions, rather than logical ones. Because if there were a logical solution, it probably would have already been solved, thereby eliminating the problem. All that’s left are the psychological problems. Examples inspired by Rory Sutherland, CMO of Ogilvy Advertising: “Any fool can sell a product by offering it for a discount, it takes great marketing to sell the same product for a premium” Logical solution: make trains faster to increase satisfaction Psychological solution: decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map Psychological solution: pay models to be the hostesses on the trip (people would wish it took longer to get to their destination!) Logical solution: make elevator faster Psychological solution: add floor to ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator Logical solution: make it cheaper Psychological solution: make fewer of them and raise the price which causes people to want it more. Often, most logical solutions have been tried and failed. At this point in history, we must give the psychological solutions a shot to solve problems. As such, as business owners, it is up to us to communicate these value drivers with clarity to increase the prospect’s perception of these realities. The extent to which you answer these questions in the mind of your prospect will determine the value you are creating. Only then, will we truly be able to realize the actual value of our product to the marketplace, and by extension, the egregious prices we want to charge.',\n",

       "    'text': \"And if we further unpack the idea of a desire to be beautiful, we see that it may be a surface-level declaration of a deeper desire to achieve higher status in one’s social group. The dream outcome value driver is most prominently used when comparing the relative value between two different desires being satisfied. In general, the dream outcome that most directly increases a prospect’s status will be the one they value most. As such, a prospect may value that entire category of vehicles that satisfy one desire more than another category that satisfies a different desire. For many men, making money is more important than being handsome. Why? Because money drives status for men more than being handsome does. So, in general, they will value all offers that make them money more than offers that help them look good. I once heard Russell Brunson tell a story about this concept. He explained how his wife, Collette, at first hearing about this status concept, rejected it. She claimed she wasn’t driven by status and would never want to drive a Lamborghini. Instead, she favored her minivan. But, after talking further, she revealed it was because driving a Lamborghini would decrease her status amongst her mom friends, while driving a minivan would show she was a good mother (increase in status). So it’s not about the money, it's about the status (the perceived increase or decrease in relative standing when compared to others socially or professionally). Talk in terms of things your prospect believes will increase their status, and you will have your prospects drooling. Pro Tip: Frame benefits in terms of status gained from the viewpoint of others When writing copy, you can make it that much more powerful by talking about how other people will perceive the prospect’s achievement. Connect the dots for them. Example: If you buy this golf club, your drive will increase by 40 yards. Your golf buddies' jaws will drop when they see your ball soar 40 yards past theirs . . . they’ll ask you what’s changed . . . only you will know.\",\n",

       "    'text': \"#2 Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Goal = Increase) This was the last of the variables I added when trying to think through this framework a few years ago. I just felt like something was missing with only the other three. Then I realized people pay for certainty. They value certainty. I call this “the perceived likelihood of achievement.” In other words, “How likely do I believe it is that I will achieve the result I am looking for if I make this purchase?” For example, how much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon’s 10,000th patient versus their first? If you're a normal, sane person, a lot more. I mean heck, you might even ask them to pay you if you are their first patient ever. So you can see even from this simple example that while the service you are receiving is technically the same, the only thing that changes is your perceived likelihood of getting what you want. Both surgeons take the same amount of time to do the surgery (if anything, the guy who has done it 10,000 times would likely get it done faster and still charge more). The more-experienced surgeon has a track record of achieving a result, which incentivizes their desirability. People value this perceived likelihood of achievement. Increasing a prospect’s conviction that your offer will “actually” work for them, will make your offer that much more valuable even though the work remains the same on your end. So to increase value with all offers, we must communicate perceived likelihood of achievement through our messaging, proof, what we choose to include or exclude in our offer, and our guarantees\",\n",

       "    'text': '#3 Time Delay (Goal = Decrease) Time delay is the time between a client buying and receiving the promised benefit. The shorter the distance between when they purchase and they receive value/the outcome, the more valuable your services or product is. There are two elements to this driver of value: Long-term outcome and short-term experience. Many times, there are short-term experiences that occur while en route to the long-term outcomes. They happen “along the way” and provide value. It’s good to understand both. The thing people buy is the long-term value, aka their “dream outcome.” But the thing that makes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience. These are little milestones a prospect sees along the way that shows them they are on the right path. We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer. We want clients to have a big emotional win early (as close as possible to their purchase). This gives them the emotional buy in and the momentum to “see it through” to their ultimate goal.',\n",

Along the way, though, as they change their bodies, they may experience higher sex drive, more energy, and an increased community of friends.

They buy the dream, but they stay for the benefits they discover along the way. The faster and more clearly you can demonstrate those benefits, the more valuable your service will be. For a weight loss customer, we would get them to meet someone else so they immediately had some social benefits from the program, and we usually gave them a more aggressive diet in the beginning.

There's just not a lot of perceived value because the perceived likelihood of achievement, the time delay to achievement, and the effort and sacrifice are so high. So even though the outcome is the same, the value of the vehicles are dramatically different, hence the difference in price. Decreasing the effort and sacrifice, or at least the perceived effort and sacrifice, can massively boost the appeal of your offer. In an ideal world, a prospect would want to simply “say yes” and have their dream outcome happen with no more effort on their behalf. This is why “done for you services” are almost always more expensive than “do-it-yourself” because the person doesn't have all the effort and sacrifice. There is also a component of “perceived likelihood of achievement” difference as well. People believe that if an expert does it, then they will be more likely to achieve the outcome than if they try on their own.\",\n",

This is the most important step in this process. This is what you are going to deliver. This is what you are going to do or provide in exchange for money. For the purposes of keeping creativity high (divergent thinking), think about anything you could possibly do. Think of all the things that might enhance the value of your offer. So much so that they would be stupid to say no. What could you do that someone would immediately say, “All that? Seriously? Yes, I'm in.” Doing this exercise will make your job of selling So. Much. Easier. Even if you come up with something you’re not actually willing to do, it’s okay. The goal here is to push your limits and jog your brain into thinking of a different version of the solution you’d normally default to. This is where you get to flex your entrepreneurial creativity. Reminder: You only need to do this once. Literally one time for a product that may last years. This is high-value, high-leverage work. You ultimately get paid for thinking. You got this. This should be fun. Go ahead and list out all your possibilities now. Then I’ll take you through my example. I’ll just use the buying food problem from earlier as an example.

       "    'text': \"Product Delivery Cheat Codes What’s that? You’re having trouble being creative? I'm going to give you the cheat codes right now, kind of like I did with the brick example: “the brick could be gold, or plastic, or have holes in it, or be a lego, etc.” Here are my “cheat codes” for product variation/enhancement and a visual to break down the process for you from my consulting deck: What level of personal attention do I want to provide? one-on-one, small group, one to many What level of effort is expected from them? Do it themselves (DIY) - figure out how to do it on their own; do it with them (DWY) - you teach them how to do it; done for them (DFY) - you do it for them If doing something live, what environment or medium do I want to deliver it in? In-person, phone support, email support, text support, Zoom support, chat support If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it? Audio, video, or written. How quickly do we want to reply? On what days? during what hours? 24/7. 9-5, within 5 minutes, within an hour, within 24 hrs? 10x to 1/10th test. If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me 1/10th the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that? How could I still make them successful for 1/10th price? Stretch your mind in either direction and you’ll come up with widely different solutions. In other words, how could I actually deliver on these solutions I am claiming I will provide. Do this for each problem because solutions from one problem will give you ideas for others you wouldn’t normally have considered. Remember, it’s important that you solve every problem. I can’t tell you the amount of times one single item becomes the reason someone doesn't buy.\",\n",

If you aren’t sure what’s high value, go through the value equation and ask yourself which of these things will this person: Financially value Cause them to believe they will be likely to succeed Make them feel like they can do it with much less effort and sacrifice Help them accomplish their goal and see the result they want with far less time investment.

Depending on whether we sell one on one or one to many, we would present this differently. I will address how to present each of these bundled items in the bonus section (next section). Summary Points We went through this entire process to accomplish one objective: to create a valuable offer that is differentiated and unable to be compared to anything else in the marketplace. We are selling something unique. As such, we are no longer bound by the normal pricing forces of commoditization. Prospects will now only make a value-based rather than a price-based decision on whether they should buy from us. Hoorah! Now that we have our core offer, the next section will be dedicated to enhancing it. We will employ a combination of psychological levers: bonuses, urgency, scarcity, guarantees, and naming.',\n",

       "    'text': 'MODERN Ql GONG These are general guidelines on how to breathe and how to thinking about your breathing during Qi Gong:\\n\\nYou\\'ll generally want to breathe in through the nose. This helps calm your nervous system down.\\n\\nTake slow, deep, full breaths. Try to connect the movement to your breath.\\n\\nBreathe in and out through the nose when you want to cultivate or keep energy contained.\\n\\nBreathe in through the nose and out the mouth when you want to release energy.\\n\\nDuring some exercises, Lee will encourage you to exhale out through the mouth. This is done specifically when you are releasing \"old or stagnant energy\". These are called \\'purging\"\\n\\nexercises. Purging is a term for releasing. When you are \"gathering\" or what is called \"tonifying\"\\n\\nthe breath is in through the nose and out through the nose.\\n\\nFor example, in the \"shaking exercise\", you\\'re releasing tension and stress from your body.\\n\\nYou\\'d breathe in through your nose and exhale out through your mouth to release the energy connected to tension and stress.\\n\\nWhen you move into the flow portion of your practice, you begin to cultivate the kind of and emotional state you want for the rest of your day. Then you\\'d breathe in and out through energy your nose to contain that positive energy and not release it.\\n\\nThese aren\\'t hard rules. They\\'re more like guidelines. If you have a condition that makes it difficult to breathe a certain way, do whatever is most comfortable for you.\\n\\nSame goes with physical limitations.\\n\\nYou will hear Lee say, \"No pain, no pain.\" Qi Gong isn\\'t a practice where you have to get the movement and the form exactly correct. If you cannot do a movement either modify it to fit your body or visualize yourself doing it. Students have recovered from surgery just visualizing themselves practicing Qi Gong in their hospital bed. Their doctors are stunned by how quickly they heal.',\n",

When people speak of destiny they often refer to a force that lies outside the reach of humanity. Yet the secret to destiny has to do with frequency. It is through this codon that the two great forces of evolution and involution come together. There is a great mystery here. Do you raise the frequency of your own DNA and change your destiny? That is the view of evolution. Or does a higher force outside you make it possible for you to raise the frequency of your DNA? That is the view of involution. The paradox can only be solved through another paradox. Both are true and both are interdependent. Heroes and heroines are made both on earth and in heaven.',\n",

Rather, it is your general attitude to life that tells your DNA what kind of person you want to become.

Negative thoughts and emotions cause your DNA to contract, whereas positive thoughts and emotions cause it to expand and relax. This process is going on all the time, from the moment you come into the world to the moment you leave. You alone are the architect of your evolution.

Each of these chemical groupings relates to an amino acid and forms what is know as a codon. There are 64 of these codons in your genetic code. Similarly, in the I Ching there are only four basic permutations of yin and yang, which are also arranged in groups of threes known as trigrams. In the same way that the two strands of your DNA reflect each other, each trigram has a partner. Together these two symbols create the hexagram; the basis of the I Ching.

If you are feeling impatient, your breathing has become shallow and your nervous system is over activated. Your core feeling is that all is not as it should be. Of course this feeling is absolutely untrue. Everything is always exactly as it should be. What has happened is that you have fallen out of your natural state — the state of trust. Impatience is always rooted in the mind and as such is unique to human beings because of the unusual nature of our neocortex which processes information in such a way that we perceive everything as happening in time — with a past, a present and a future. The only way to escape impatience is to escape the mind and its realm of time, which is precisely what happens at the higher frequencies of this Gene Key.',\n",

The body is designed to awaken to these higher frequencies, which is why humanity really only seeks one thing — to live in the state of love. The more you are able to settle into a deep trust and patience with the rhythm of your own life, the more your heart will open and the softer and more yielding you will become in your attitude to everything and everyone that comes your way. You will begin to discover a higher functioning of your DNA — a code within a code. This code is not dependent on anything or anyone outside you.

When you wait and allow life to reveal its natural rhythms, you also come to realise that life knows best. Hindsight shows you repeatedly that life is constructed of beautiful and perfect patterns woven into wonderful tapestries and that your individual life follows such cosmic patterns. If you know how to wait calmly, you will realise that you are always a part of these wider patterns, and that they actually support you at all times — even the most challenging times. Above all, the Gift of Patience allows you to hear life’s music. It tunes you into the subtle metronome behind your life. It allows you to breathe deeply into your belly and never feel trapped by your outer life situation. Patience smoothes rough edges, keeps your heart and mind open and makes life seem simple and easy. When you become impatient, even for a moment, you have stopped listening and trusting in the greater life. For these reasons, it is patience that has always been the true gauge and measure of the greatness of a person’s soul.',\n",

The second function of Mediocrity is to serve the machinery of society rather than evolution. In other words, you become a cog in the wheel of the systems established by man. In so doing, you become a part of the background of life rather than a major player. Mediocrity prevents people from being heroes or heroines.

We may watch the films and movies of others and may even be deeply moved by them, but the 8th Shadow prevents us from believing in ourselves enough to embody such a life. And the reason is fear.

Every intentional act is a magical act, setting in motion either a force of creativity or a force of decay. Whenever you stand at the beginning of a journey, it is the first step that sets the tone for the entire journey and the next few steps that begin to create the groove. After even a relatively few steps then, it becomes very difficult to change your direction since that involves wrenching yourself out of your existing groove and creating a new one. Therefore whenever you reach a natural beginning — of a new cycle, a new relationship, a new home, even a new year — you would do well to remember this truth: those first few steps are critical to your evolution in the time ahead.

If you quit something too soon you will stay in the same old loop, but if you follow experiences through to the end you will make quantum leaps, both in terms of your good fortune and your fulfilment. You need to see that this Shadow, like all the Shadows, has a beneficial purpose in the long run. It teaches you the value of your experiences when you look back upon them with hindsight. If you look back and keep seeing the same old emotional traumas repeating in your life, you will eventually learn what you are doing or not doing that is causing these patterns.',\n",

In fact, the freedom and spontaneity of our children is a constant reminder of the depth of our own conditioning and unhappiness. This is one reason why modern parents find it so hard to be parents; they have forgotten how to be happy deep within their bodies. In truth, they have forgotten how to play.

Despite the fact that this 14th Gene Key is all about personal power, the 14th Siddhi is about the end of all things personal. At this level, we need to view humanity as one large expanding genetic vehicle. Each individual human is simply another set of bio-energetic instructions in the greater body. In this sense, individuality is actually the same thing as interference. If a cell within the body behaves as though it has an identity of its own, it cannot function cleanly. It is as though the windows of that cell are dirty and information cannot pass efficiently and transparently from the greater body to the cell. Its illness is that it thinks it exists autonomously. Likewise we humans, complex though we like to think ourselves, are akin to single-celled organisms within a far greater body. We are merely building blocks for a higher life, and in that sense we are utterly expendable. It is not us that matter — there is no us — there is only the siddhic programming — to create more and more abundance, in every direction and at every level of consciousness. That is the true definition of bounteousness.',\n",

Everything of true value is hidden inside form — inside your body, inside the ferrous core of the planet, inside the vibrating fabric of your inner being. It is all rooted inwardly. This is why humankind must discover inner space, why we must turn inward for inspiration. All the answers to all our problems and challenges are hidden in the creatures and structures of nature, and all of those structures and creatures are embedded in microcosmic form inside every molecule of our DNA.

It is all very well having a wonderful idea that will change the world, but without the realism of the 60th Gift, this idea will probably never amount to anything. Another synonym for the 60th Gift might be the gift of common sense. Common sense is inherent to all human beings, but it is lost whenever a person or society becomes too bogged down in frameworks and structures. It is through common sense that we human beings evolve and cooperate with creation efficiently and harmoniously. The power and potential inherent in this 60th Gift should never be taken for granted. People with the 60th Gift understand that for anything new to take root in the material world, it must follow certain laws. The main law of manifestation in the material world is based on structure.

The 60th Gift is like the spaceship that takes man to the moon. Once man has reached the moon, the spaceship is no longer needed, but its creation allows other more advanced structures to evolve. To take this simile further, the Gift of Realism is about maintaining the balance between the idea of reaching the moon, and the huge physical and economical requirements needed to actually make that idea a reality. But the real essence of this Gene Key is about not losing perspective from either the idea side or the structure side. We have already seen how an over-reliance on the structural side ensures that most ideas are either bogged down and never happen, or else end up far from their original vision.',\n",

In social psychology this common human pattern is known as the diffusion of responsibility and refers to the human preponderance to look away when confronted by another in distress, often when there are a number of other people in the same vicinity. However, as a by-product of the 16th Shadow of Indifference, the diffusion of responsibility occurs across the width and breadth of our planet on a far subtler energetic level. Indifference is an energy field created by all the human beings on this planet who are not doing what they would really love to be doing. The only reason for this state is fear. Whoever you are and whatever your life circumstances, if you transcend your fear you will suddenly become so much more capable than you were before.',\n",

       "    'text': 'What is lacking in the lives of those in the grip of this Shadow is one vital factor — enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is the original Chinese name for this 16th Hexagram of the I Ching. Enthusiasm is the key that can pull you out of your inertia and snap the frozen pattern of your indifference. To be enthused, you must actually have an experience rather than simply dreaming about an experience. One of the greatest challenges in surmounting the collective weight of indifference is your unique inability to identify with whatever your dreams really are. This is why experience is critical to this process of breaking free. It is not enough to daydream and plan how you might save the world — you have to actually begin the work. The other major excuse of those under the spell of this Shadow is “I am not ready yet”. Again, this excuse is based on a false notion of time. The truth is that you are always ready. You are ready right now. If you keep postponing your dreams, they will always remain dreams. If you actually have the courage to begin them, you will learn as you go along. When you have the courage to step onto the path of your destiny, two things immediately occur — the first is that you feel an enormous surge of new energy coming from your own enthusiasm and the second is that you stop compromising your path because of pressure coming from others.',\n",

No matter how skilled you are, if you don’t have this enthusiasm you cannot attain the next level, which is talent. Furthermore, talent is something that must be earned over a period of time (no less than seven years), and its natural expression is versatility. You could say that skill is a vertical approach to learning, in that you have to focus great attention in one direction, and your whole impetus is to understand and learn as much in that field as you can. Versatility marks a shift in frequency in your whole being because it opens up the horizontal field at the same time as the vertical. You are no longer fixed to a single discipline but begin to view life at a holistic level, seeing how all systems and techniques interconnect in a truly integral way. You can thus apply your talent across the whole spectrum of human sciences and arts, without the dogmatic limitation of being tied to one single direction. At this level, you are tapping the natural laws behind all life processes, so your talents can be transferred easily between disciplines, even those that appear far apart and unrelated.',\n",

Once you have become trapped in these addictive mental patterns, it is very difficult to recognise them and break out of them. However, in every turn of the wheel of fantasy, as the cycles of your life periodically reset themselves, there is that chance that the next time round, the code will be correctly interpreted.

All works of genius emerge from this field. Mozart is a fine example of a man with a strongly activated 41st Gift. His ability to read the completed scores of all his finest works straight from the morphogenetic field is well documented, although it may not have been described in this kind of language before. Mozart was born into a world of music and was intensively tutored by his own father, one of Europe’s leading musical masters. It is unsurprising then that Mozart picked up on the burgeoning musical morphogenetic field of his era, now known as the classical style. He anticipated its maturation and manifested it in the material plane. This is the real difference between the 41st Gift and the 41st Shadow. It is the difference between genius and non-genius. Genius manifests whilst non-genius dreams.',\n",

Even though we may look at DNA as a double helix with the four bases strung out along a line of code, its actual functioning within the body as a whole is in no way linear. The implications of the above are astounding. Every single start codon inside every single cell of your body is electromagnetically linked to each other. This is the foundation of the holographic body, which in turn is linked electromagnetically to the holographic universe. Every impulse inside you is therefore communicated to the whole, just as every impulse within the whole is chemically mirrored in your DNA. Once you have discovered the knack of influencing your own DNA, you can literally reprogram every cell within your body. However, in order to activate secret chemical formulae inside your body that accompany the highest states of consciousness, you must learn to overcome the inertia of humanity as a whole.

When we extend this model at a macrocosmic level to its ultimate frequency, we reach something both spectacular and terrifying. The question is: What does the cosmic start codon look like, and what does it mean to arrive at the source of all being? As the source of being, the 41st Siddhi is the Siddhi of Emanation. Emanation is a word that has been used by many ancient metaphysical and mystical systems as a means for understanding something that is really unapproachable. One of the best known of these systems is perhaps the Kabbalah, whose central tenet is a map known as the doctrine of emanation. In a nutshell, the doctrine of emanation points towards a fractal model of the universe in which everything emerges infinitely as a mirror image of itself.',\n",

Somewhere deep within your DNA lies a code whose sole purpose is to trigger the state we call enlightenment. In certain vehicles the body picks up a specific set of secret genetic instructions and triggers the neurological process of enlightenment. It may come as a shock to many mystical seekers that this process cannot be triggered by what we do up on the surface. Within the hologram of the universe, enlightenment is a spontaneous acausal non-event. You could say that Grace triggers this process, but the point is that it is a chemical process and no one knows why or when or to whom it will happen.

       "    'text': 'The great secret to this 32nd Siddhi is to be found in the simplest of symbols — water. In human physiology, the 32nd Gene Key represents the regulation of liquid in your body. This is why it has such a deep connection with your genetic memory, since water holds memory. There is a peculiarity within the hydrogen atom that allows it to transfer consciousness as memory. Since our planet and our bodies are made up primarily of water, this is the medium through which our collective consciousness evolves. The water cycle on our planet is actually how we are awakening. Every form that dies releases its water content back into the water cycle, which means that every form releases a finite number of more evolved hydrogen atoms back into the world. Thus, the hydrogen atoms in every vegetable you eat pass through your body and leave through your sweat or urine more evolved than when they entered your body. This evolving chain of consciousness is present and occurring in every single life form on our planet through the medium of the water in the food chain. The key to evolution is digestion! The more you contemplate this 32nd Siddhi, the more reverence you will inevitably feel for all life. As it penetrates deeper and deeper into your heart, you will begin to smell the divine perfume of consciousness as it moves between and behind all forms of life. Eventually, no matter what is before you, all you will see is the Self, the Atman, the Divine being, perfectly playing and weaving and evolving right before your very eyes.',\n",

There is great lightness and humour in this Gene Key.',\n",

       "    'text': 'The 56th Gift knows a great truth — true enjoyment is rooted inside your being rather than in the external. As you begin to embody this truth, your awareness naturally turns inward. The same energy that would have become a distraction in the outer world turns inward towards your own source. As it does so it causes an inner transformation. Over a period of time, the 56th Gift actually trains you how to meditate. You may not meditate formally, but you enter into a state of meditation where sensual desires are seen for what they are — illusory attempts at fulfilment. This does not mean that you become some kind of mendicant or ascetic, but it does break your addiction to seeking fulfilment in the external world. As this occurs, the life lived through your senses becomes highly refined. You even begin to develop your extra senses — the higher attributes of your subtle bodies beyond the physical, emotional and mental worlds.',\n",

It means that you find wonder where others find monotony and you find beauty where others see ugliness. It is about appreciation and gratitude — the more grateful you are for every moment, the more the moment comes alive within you. Above all, the 56th Gift’s greatest potential genius lies in communication. It is able to entertain and divert the attention of others. At a lower frequency range, this Gene Key may be found in advertising and political spin, and at a higher frequency, it may be found in comedians, entertainers or inspirational speakers. At even higher frequency bands, it is the great and ancient art of storytelling or myth-making — the sharing of personal experiences that have touched and opened one’s own heart. At these higher levels, this 56th Gift of Enrichment is a Gift of love, for the more you enrich the lives of others, the more this Gift pours through your heart.',\n",

       "    'text': 'A narina direita é o pedal do acelerador. Quando você inspira por esse canal, a circulação acelera, seu corpo fica mais quente e os níveis de cortisol, pressão arterial e frequência cardíaca aumentam. Isso acontece porque respirar pelo lado direito do nariz ativa o sistema nervoso simpático, o mecanismo de \"luta ou fuga\" que coloca o corpo em um estado mais elevado de alerta e prontidão. A respiração pela narina direita também fornecerá mais sangue ao hemisfério oposto do cérebro,3 especificamente ao córtex pré-frontal, que tem sido associado a decisões lógicas, linguagem e computação.\\n\\nA inspiração pela narina esquerda tem o efeito oposto: funciona como uma espécie de freio no acelerador da narina direita. A narina esquerda está mais profundamente conectada ao sistema nervoso parassimpático, o lado de descanso e relaxamento que reduz a pressão sanguínea,4 esfria o corpo e reduz a ansiedade. A respiração pela narina esquerda muda o fluxo sanguíneo para o lado oposto do córtex pré-frontal, para a área que influencia o pensamento criativo e desempenha um papel na formação de abstrações mentais e na produção de emoções negativas.',\n",

What are the possible outcomes? Being made a laughingstock? Getting rejected? We don’t want to speak out, but why? Because we might be criticized? Because in the absolute worst-case scenario, we might have to go look for a new job—but weren’t we already thinking about that anyway? Because we could die or be killed? Just as we could every time we get on a plane, every time we cross a street, every time we wake up as a fragile, mortal being? We need also to cultivate the courage to think about all the things that could happen, the things that are unpleasant to think about, the unusual, the unexpected, the unlikely.

It’s impossible to beat an enemy you do not understand, and fear—in all its forms, from terror to apathy to hatred to playing it small—is the enemy of courage. We are in a battle against fear. So we have to study fear, get familiar with it, grapple with its causes and symptoms. This is why the Spartans built temples to fear. To keep it close. To see its power. To ward it off. The brave are not without fear—no human is—rather, it’s their ability to rise above it and master it that makes them so remarkable. In fact, it must be said that greatness is impossible without doing this. Of cowards, though, nothing is written. Nothing is remembered. Nothing is admired.',\n",

       "    'text': 'WHM PROTOCOL: BASIC BREATHING EXERCISE Before engaging with this breathing technique, remember to be mindful. Listen to your body and learn from the signals your body and mind send you while you are doing the exercises. Use those signals as personal feedback about the effect of the exercises on your body and mind, and adjust them as needed to find what works best for you.3 STEP 1Sit in a meditation posture, lying down, or whichever way is most comfortable for you, in a quiet and safe environment. Make sure you can expand your lungs freely without feeling any constriction. STEP 2Close your eyes and try to clear your mind. Be conscious about your breath and try to fully connect with it. Take thirty to forty deep breaths in through the nose or mouth. Fill up your belly, your chest, all the way up to your head. Don’t force the exhale. Just relax and let the air out. Fully in, letting go. STEP 3At the end of the last breath, draw the breath in once more and fill the lungs to maximum capacity without using any force. Then relax to let the air out. Hold the breath until you feel the urge to breathe again. This is called the retention phase. STEP 4When you feel the urge to breathe, take one deep breath in and hold it for ten to fifteen seconds. This is called the recovery breath. STEP 5Let your breath go and start with a new round. Fully in, letting go. Repeat the full cycle three to four times. After having completed this breathing exercise, take your time to enjoy the feeling. With repeated practice, this protocol becomes more and more like a meditation.',\n",

Do this by organizing your thoughts. Basically, this is the way you want others to perceive you, as well as the way you want to live your personal and professional life. To create your vision, it is necessary to really understand the needs of your tribe. If you really want to understand your tribe’s needs, you must walk in their shoes. Ask yourself, how will your brand really enhance the lives of those in your tribe? What drives you? Why does this drive you? What exactly do you want to achieve? What is the message you want the world to hear? When developing your vision, I suggest that you sit down and write out a list of fifty plus words that you would use to describe your brand and where it is headed. From here, the strongest themes driving your brand will start to become apparent. Like every exercise in this book, make sure your vision is true to your authentic self and so strong that it really is the essence of YOU and who you are.',\n",

Nothing outside yourself can control your thinking or your actions. 2. Avoid blaming yourself for not being in control. You are doing the best you can, and you are on the way to reclaiming your power. 3. Be aware of when and where you play the victim role. Learn the clues that tell you that you are not being responsible for what you are being, having, doing, or feeling. 4. Familiarize yourself with your biggest enemy—your Chatterbox. Use the exercises throughout this book to replace it with a loving internal friend. 5. Figure out the payoffs that keep you “stuck.” Paradoxically, once you find them, you will probably be able to quickly become “unstuck.” 6. Determine what you want in life and act on it. Stop waiting for someone to give it to you. You’ll be waiting a long time. 7. Be aware of the many choices you have—in both actions and feelings—in any situation that comes your way. Choose the path that contributes to your growth and makes you feel at peace with yourself and others.',\n",

       "    'text': 'In his book Actualizations, Stewart Emery presents an excellent model for changing your direction in life. He learned it while seated on the flight deck of an airplane on the way to Honolulu. He noticed a console, which was identified by the pilot as the inertial guidance system. The purpose of the system was to get the plane within one thousand yards of the runway in Hawaii within five minutes of the estimated arrival time. Each time the plane strayed off course, the system corrected it. The pilot explained that they would arrive in Hawaii on time in spite of “having been in error 90 percent of the time.” Emery takes it from there, stating: “So the path from here to where we want to be starts with an error, which we correct, which becomes the next error, which we correct and that becomes the next error, which we correct. So the only time we are truly on course is that moment in the zigzag when we actually cross the true path.” From the analogy, we see that the trick in life is not to worry about making a wrong decision; it’s learning when to correct! My concept of the model looks like this:',\n",

Ask yourself: What about this experience worked? What “usefulness” can you get from this experience to improve your future? What can you learn from this experience about what you don’t want? Knowing what you know now, because you’ve had this experience, how will you approach your future differently? What about this experience are you grateful for? When you’re in the GAIN, you take full ownership over your own experiences. By taking full ownership of your experiences and past, you can do whatever you want with them. You can change what your former experiences mean, and what they don’t mean. When you’re in the GAIN, you transform your experiences.',\n",

When you have a disorganized past, you don’t really understand your emotions or thoughts, even though they’re still impacting you. A disorganized and nontransformed past is chaotic and confusing. Another word for this is trauma. Trauma happens when your expectations are violated such that you lose your sense of meaning for life and worth as a person.22 It is a dysfunctional belief about an experience that creates ongoing dysfunction in the present and future. Trauma occurs when a person is avoiding and resenting their past, rather than approaching and transforming their past.23 Your past is not fixed, but flexible.

We are all able to color our past either happy or sad.”24 The past is nothing more than the meaning you ascribe to it. Traumatic experiences can be changed. They are not fixed. Motivation is often broken into one of two categories: approach or avoid.25 Being in the GAP leads you to avoid your past. It makes you the victim. It stops you from taking ownership. Being in the GAIN allows you to transform your experiences into GAINS, and give them the meanings you choose. The sooner you frame your experience as a GAIN rather than a GAP, the faster you’ll be able to move forward and heal traumas. This is actually how you know someone has healed from trauma: they genuinely view their past experiences as a GAIN. They can honestly say they’re grateful for the lessons they learned from them.26,27,28',\n",

A composição só funciona se você puder dar anos e anos a um ativo para que ele cresça.

No entanto, obter e manter esse crescimento extraordinário requer sobreviver a todos os altos e baixos imprevisíveis que todo mundo, invariavelmente, experimenta ao longo do tempo.',\n",

Se o seu trabalho é montar carros, não há muito a ser feito quando você não está na linha de montagem. Você se desliga do trabalho e deixa as ferramentas na fábrica.

Você pode estar pensando no seu projeto ao voltar para casa, ao preparar o jantar, ao colocar seus filhos para dormir e ao acordar, ansioso, às três da manhã. Talvez você trabalhe menos horas do que em 1950, mas a sensação é de estar trabalhando 24 horas por dia, sete dias por semana. Em um texto publicado na revista The Atlantic, o jornalista Derek Thompson descreveu o fenômeno assim: Se o equipamento operacional do século XXI é um dispositivo portátil, isso significa que o espaço de trabalho não é mais a fábrica. É o dia em si. A tecnologia levou as ferramentas de produtividade para além do escritório. Graças aos laptops e aos smartphones, que são dispositivos portáteis de criação de mídia de todo tipo, a maioria dos indivíduos que exercem atividades intelectuais pode, em tese, produzir da mesma forma às duas horas da tarde no escritório principal, às duas horas da manhã em um espaço de coworking no Japão ou à meia-noite no sofá de casa.[ 29 ]',\n",

With nothing but the power of your own mind, you operate on the symbols before you in such a way that you gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding less to one of understanding more. Such elevation, accomplished by the mind working on a book, is highly skilled reading, the kind of reading that a book which challenges your understanding deserves. Thus we can roughly define what we mean by the art of reading as follows: the process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from outside,I elevates itself by the power of its own operations. The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more. The skilled operations that cause this to happen are the various acts that constitute the art of reading. To pass from understanding less to understanding more by your own intellectual effort in reading is something like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. It certainly feels that way. It is a major exertion. Obviously, it is a more active kind of reading than you have done before, entailing not only more varied activity but also much more skill in the performance of the various acts required. Obviously, too, the things that are usually regarded as more difficult to read, and hence as only for the better reader, are those that are more likely to deserve and demand this kind of reading.',\n",

It is probably true that one does less thinking when one reads for information or entertainment than when one is undertaking to discover something. Those are the less active sorts of reading. But it is not true of the more active reading—the effort to understand. No one who has done this sort of reading would say it can be done thoughtlessly. Thinking is only one part of the activity of learning. One must also use one’s senses and imagination. One must observe, and remember, and construct imaginatively what cannot be observed. There is, again, a tendency to stress the role of these activities in the process of unaided discovery and to forget or minimize their place in the process of being taught through reading or listening. For example, many people assume that though a poet must use his imagination in writing a poem, they do not have to use their imagination in reading it. The art of reading, in short, includes all of the same skills that are involved in the art of unaided discovery: keenness of observation, readily available memory, range of imagination, and, of course, an intellect trained in analysis and reflection. The reason for this is that reading in this sense is discovery, too—although with help instead of without it.',\n",

I think the key to that is really focusing on making things. There is a creator mindset you may have heard of like creators or the creator economy. When you approach the Internet from the perspective of a consumer, you'll instantly get overwhelmed. It's like there's way too much to consume. You'll never get to the end of it, you'll never get to even 1% of 1% of it. It's crazy. Whereas when you shift into creator and when I say creator, I don't mean just you have a Youtube channel, you have a podcast, you have a blog. Like, like don't think of the people, the thought leaders that you follow online. You know, don't think of me and vision just even in your company on your team. Think about yourself as a creator, right? Like when you take notes from a meeting, do those notes just get filed away. Never to be seen again. Like imagine if you just took a few, like three minutes after the end of the meeting to just organize the notes a little bit like you saw we should do and send them out to the people that were in the meeting. Like I love when people do that, it's such a service. Right? You've already taken the notes. Just take a few minutes, create a summary of the meetings, send them out to people and that will enhance your reputation. People will start to feel like you're doing them a favor because you are, they'll look for ways to help you like that. Karma will come back to you. Just make things. And suddenly when you make things, you realize that you don't need very much to make things, you know, like All right. You saw my blog post thousands of words. I often just have 3 to 5 sources. I just have a quote, a statistic, a few bullet points a, you know, a graphic and I just pull those together and suddenly I have a massive blog post.

He had grown up in a wealthy family, but according to him, his parents spent much of every day in a pitched battle with each other. Without realizing it, he was carrying on in his own marriage the family tradition of constant bickering. In his original family, the formula was “money equals arguing.” It didn’t matter if the amount was a hundred million dollars or a few bucks for good toilet paper; if there was money involved, there had to be an argument about it.',\n",

He was separated again when he was a one-year-old and his mother went to the hospital to have another baby. From these two life experiences, the child, who loves his mother very much, expects abandonment from the one he loves most. Whenever any degree of abandonment happens later in life, it is experienced with the same force of devastation as the first time. From such deep trauma, we form an image conclusion. An image conclusion is based on experience—in this case, the experience of abandonment. It is based on child’s logic that states, “If I love, I will be abandoned.” This image conclusion then colors all similar situations. Obviously, one-year-old Joe is not conscious of having such an opinion. Instead, it is unconsciously held in his belief system and is carried throughout life.

These actions carry pleasure because they are releases of energy that has been stored up inside. If you experience pain when the energy first begins to move, it will always soon be followed by pleasure, because as you release the pain, you also release the creative force, which is always experienced as pleasure. Negative pleasure originates in our lower self. Our lower self is the part of us that has forgotten who we are. It is the part of our psyche that believes in a separated, negative world and acts accordingly. The lower self is not in denial of negativity. It enjoys it. It has the intention to have negative pleasure. Since the lower self is not in denial of negativity as the mask is, it is more honest than the mask self. The lower self is truthful about its negative intent. It doesn’t pretend to be nice. It is not nice. It puts its self first and makes no bones about it.

The degree of our expression is directly proportional to how firmly and clearly we are connected to and allow our core essence to come forth. The areas of our lives that flow smoothly, without problems, and satisfy us fully are those where we are directly connected to our core. Energies that come uninhibited directly from the core create great human works and great human lives. Energies that come uninhibited directly from the core create great health. They are the expression of our higher selves, the part of us with which we are born and that never loses its connection to the core. We are usually quite shy about this part of us. Most of the time we do not show how much we care, how much we love, and how much we long for in life. We cover it, we label it, we squelch it to a “reasonable” degree of expression (according to internalized parental voices) and settle for less. This is “appropriate” behavior, or so we believe. Sometimes when we are not vigilant we let go, and out comes the creative force! A sudden act of kindness or expression of love or friendship that happens before we think about it is an expression of this core essence. A moment of close connection is made, and love is released. Then, not being able to tolerate the light and love, we become shy and pull away. It takes only a few seconds for us to catch ourselves in embarrassment and close off a bit. A sudden fear emerges seemingly from nowhere that says “Oh, maybe I did the wrong thing.” That is the parental voice speaking, replacing the core. Under it lies the defense. It really means, “If you don’t stop this energy flow, you will probably feel everything, including the pain that I am burying for you.” So we stop the flow of our life-force, we contain it and dampen it. We bring ourselves back to the “normal” level of “safety” where we won’t rock any boats—least of all our own. This is the human condition. We live in the duality of choice, no matter what our life circumstances. Each moment we choose to say yes to a balanced, powerful, and safe undefendedness that brings about our full experience of life, or we choose to say no. In our no, we defend against true balanced life experience and block out our aliveness. Most of us choose to kill some of our aliveness most of the time. Why? Because unconsciously, we know that to let the life-force flow would knock loose the old pain, and we are afraid of it. We don’t know how to handle it. So we retreat from the defense and go back to the old, seemingly adequate mask definitions of who we are.',\n",

The original wound is created by the fading of the connection between the newborn and its deeper spiritual wisdom within its core. Why, from the evolutionary perspective of humankind, would this take place? The answer lies in the difference between the core connection in early life and the connection gained through life experience. The early connection to the core is unconscious. The connections to the core that are made during the process of living are conscious. Adults’ connection to their core, which is brought about through life experience, creates conscious awareness of their inner divinity. Adults become aware that they are a spark of divine light in the universe. They are localized divinity. This evolutionary process creates more conscious awareness in our species. We are finding out that we are co-creators of the universe. The purpose of incarnation is the creation of awareness of self as divine co-creator of the universe.',\n",

Each of these levels can be perceived with HSP and can be directly worked on for healing by a trained healer. Figure 2-1 shows these four dimensions of our humanness; the physical level, the auric level, the haric level, and the core star level. The first dimension is the familiar physical world. Our physical world is held intact by underlying worlds of energy and consciousness. Directly under the physical world is the dimension of the universal or life energy fields in which the aura or human energy field exists. This level is the energetic framework or grid structure upon which the physical world rests. Everything that is created in the physical world must first exist or be created in the world of life energy. Every form that exists must first be formed in the structured levels of the energy fields. This dimension also carries the energies of our personality. Every feeling that we have exists in the level of the life energy fields. The physical body expresses the fluid levels of the field in such things as smiles of love, or frowns of disapproval, the way we walk, sit, and stand. Beneath the human energy field lies the haric level, in which we hold our intentions. Our intentions have a tremendous importance in the creative process. When we have unconscious, mixed, or opposing intentions, we fight against ourselves and disrupt the creative process. When we learn to align our intentions not only within ourselves but with the immediate group of people with whom we work, then…',\n",

       "    'text': 'Dr. Robert Beck, a nuclear physicist, traveled the world measuring the brain waves of healers. He found that all healers exhibit the same brain-wave pattern of 7.8–8 Hz during the times they are giving healings, no matter what their customs or how opposed to each other their customs were. Beck tested charismatic Christian faith healers, Hawaiian kahunas, practitioners of wicca, santeria, radesthesia, and radionics, as well as seers, ESP readers, and psychics. They all tested the same. He then asked to what drummer they were marching. And indeed, why. He found the answer in the fluctuations of the earth’s magnetic field. It fluctuates between 7.8 and 8 Hz. These fluctuations are called Schumann waves. Upon further investigation, he found that during healing moments, the healer’s brain waves became both frequency- and phase-synchronized with the Schumann waves. That means the healer’s brain waves pulse not only at the same frequency but also at the same time as the earth’s Schumann waves. It could be assumed that healers are able to take energy from the magnetic field of the earth for the healing of patients. This process is called field coupling. Dr. John Zimmerman, founder and president of the Bio-Electro-Magnetics Institute of Reno, Nevada, has extensively studied the literature of many works on field coupling and correlated it with healers’ experiences. It is clear that what healers call grounding into the earth is the action of linking up with the magnetic field of the earth, both in frequency and in phase. He has found that once healers have linked up with the Schumann waves, the right and left hemispheres of their brain become balanced with each other and show a 7.8–8 Hz alpha rhythm. After they link with the patient for some time of laying on of hands healing, it has been shown that patients’ brain waves also go into alpha and are phase-synchronized with the healers’, as well as right-left balanced. The healer has, in effect, linked the client with the earth’s magnetic field pulses and has thereby tapped into a tremendous energy source for healing.',\n",

In other words, when we try not to feel negative emotions about ourselves (second level) and/or about another person (fourth level), we stop the energy flow in the second and fourth levels. The energy flow in the third level then becomes distorted by this “squeeze.” Another way to understand this is to remember that the natural state of energy is constant movement. When the movement of energy is stopped in the second and fourth levels in order to stop negative emotions, some of that momentum is transferred into the third level. The momentum that moves into the third level causes mental activity. The activity is distorted because it is not free to move naturally and it is squeezed in by the energies just below and just above it.',\n",

This divine will exists within you and all around you. You have free will to either align yourself with this divine will or not. Divine will is a template or pattern for the great evolutionary plan of humanity and the universe. This template is alive, pulsating, and constantly unfolding. It has a powerful, almost inexorable feeling of will and purpose. To experience it is to experience perfect order. It is a world of precision and a level of precise tones. This is the level of symbols. If you are aligned with divine will, your fifth level will be strong, full of energy. Its pattern will fit the universal pattern of divine will, a pattern that also can be seen with HSP on this level. You will feel great power and connectedness with all that is around you because you will be in your place with your purpose and synchronized with all places and purposes. If you open your vision to this level, you will see that you are, in fact, co-creating this alive, pulsating template that determines world order. Your place in the universal scheme of things is determined and created by you on a deeper level within you, the haric level. It will be discussed in greater detail later in this chapter. If your fifth level is strong, you are one of those people who understand and maintain order in your life. “A place for…',\n",

This is the level of feelings within the world of our spirit; it is the level of our divine love. Sitting in this level of conscious awareness brings a great calming effect to the body for healing. It contains the ecstasy within our spirituality. It is experienced as spiritual love, as joy, elation, and bliss. We reach this level of experience by silencing the noisy mind and listening. We reach it through meditation, through religious or fine music, chanting or reverie. Here are great feelings of expansion where we commune in brotherhood with all the beings of the spiritual worlds of various heavens as well as all of humanity, plants, and animals of the earth.

They are interwoven to form all the physical components of your physical body. They extend out from your body three to three and a half feet. At this distance, the seventh level forms into a golden egg that surrounds and protects everything within it. The outer edge of this egg is thicker and stronger, like an eggshell. It regulates a proper flow of energy out from the entire aura into the space beyond. It prevents energy leakage out of the field, as well as penetration by unhealthy energies from the outside. The seventh level serves to hold the entire field together. I am always amazed by the tremendous strength that exists at this level. The seventh level golden threads of light also exist throughout and around everything. These threads knit everything together, whether they be the cells of an organ, a body, a group of people, or the whole world. The seventh level is the level of divine mind. When it is healthy and we bring our conscious awareness to this level, we experience divine mind within us and enter into the world of the universal divine mind field.

It includes our personal individual essence and the essence of everything else combined, which is called universal essence. All creation comes out of that essence: our consciousness, mind, feelings, and matter, including our physical body. Our health is a result of bringing our true unique essence through our consciousness, mind, feelings, and physical body. Our health or disease is created by us through this process. It is us. Disease is the result of a distortion in our consciousness (our intent) that blocks the expression of our essence from coming through all the levels into the physical. Dis-ease is an expression of how we have tried to separate ourselves from our deeper being, our essence.',\n",

To do that, we divide everything into separate parts and study them. Unfortunately, in the past forty years or so, we have placed more and more emphasis on rationally dividing our world into separate parts and studying those parts as if they were isolated. Yet research shows that isolation simply is not true. For over twenty years our experiments in physics and biology have shown that everything is connected.

What he means is that true reality is like the energy in the laser beams that carries information. What we see as reality is more like the projected three-dimensional picture of the apple in the hologram. The true reality is to be found in the energy that our senses pick up rather than in the objects we define as real.',\n",

       "    'text': 'When Higher Sense Perception opens, a person can see energy fields surrounding and interpenetrating everything, including the human body. These energy fields are intimately associated with all life functions and change constantly in accordance with life function, including physical, mental, and spiritual life functions. The human energy field, or aura, is composed of seven energy levels, as we have seen. Each level has constantly changing patterns of energy that pulse with the life-force. Each level is composed of higher vibrations or pulsations than the one it surrounds and interpenetrates. These patterns change with health, sickness, and the dying process. When we learn about the human energy field and observe it for a while, a new idea dawns. The human energy field isn’t just an energy field. It is the person. In fact, it is more the person than the physical body is. The levels of the human energy field are really energy bodies. They are you. You are energy. You are not in your physical body—your physical body is in you. From this perspective, then, when you die, something very different happens.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Let fear be your ally. Fear has a great deal to teach you. Fear is the experience of being disconnected from who you truly are; it is the opposite of love. Fear can be an ally if you allow it to be, and just say, I’m afraid. In continually doing this, you begin to see that you are not fear itself, but that fear rather is a feeling. “I am afraid” becomes “I feel fear.” It is the reaction of holding feelings because you believe they are coming too fast. These feelings are based on a great many assumptions of what might happen. Most fear is not of what is happening now but of what might be. If you are able to stay in the moment, fear will not find you. Fear is the projection of something that has happened in the past, into the future, through a large magnifying glass. So when you are in fear, you are not in reality. But rather than deny that you feel it, just say what you feel in the moment. This act alone will bring you into the moment, and thereby out of fear.',\n",

It stunts us and makes us less than we are and were born to be. If you believe in God (and I do) you must declare Resistance evil, for it prevents us from achieving the life God intended when He endowed each of us with our own unique genius. Genius is a Latin word; the Romans used it to denote an inner spirit, holy and inviolable, which watches over us, guiding us to our calling. A writer writes with his genius; an artist paints with hers; everyone who creates operates from this sacramental center. It is our soul's seat, the vessel that holds our being-in-potential, our star's beacon and Polaris. Every sun casts a shadow, and genius's shadow is Resistance. As powerful as is our soul's call to realization, so potent are the forces of Resistance arrayed against it. Resistance is faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, harder to kick than crack cocaine. We're not alone if we've been mowed down by Resistance; millions of good men and women have bitten the dust before us. And here's the biggest bitch: We don't even know what hit us. I never did. From age twenty-four to thirty-two, Resistance kicked my ass from East Coast to West and back again thirteen times and I never even knew it existed. I looked everywhere for the enemy and failed to see it right in front of my face.\",\n",

In the states of savagery, of barbarism, in nomadic culture, medieval society, in the tribe and the clan, one's position was fixed by the commandments of the community. It was only with the advent of modernity (starting with the ancient Greeks), with the birth of freedom and of the individual, that such matters ascended to the fore. These are not easy questions. Who am I? Why am I here? They're not easy because the human being isn't wired to function as an individual. We're wired tribally, to act as part of a group. Our psyches are programmed by millions of years of hunter-gatherer evolution. We know what the clan is; we know how to fit into the band and the tribe. What we don't know is how to be alone. We don't know how to be free individuals.\",\n",

Instead of showing us our fear (which might shame us and impel us to do our work), Resistance presents us with a series of plausible, rational justifications for why we shouldn't do our work.

It stunts us and makes us less than we are and were born to be. If you believe in God (and I do) you must declare Resistance evil, for it prevents us from achieving the life God intended when He endowed each of us with our own unique genius. Genius is a Latin word; the Romans used it to denote an inner spirit, holy and inviolable, which watches over us, guiding us to our calling. A writer writes with his genius; an artist paints with hers; everyone who creates operates from this sacramental center. It is our soul’s seat, the vessel that holds our being-in-potential, our star’s beacon and Polaris. \\xa0 Every sun casts a shadow, and genius’s shadow is Resistance. As powerful as is our soul’s call to realization, so potent are the forces of Resistance arrayed against it. Resistance is faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, harder to kick than crack cocaine. We’re not alone if we’ve been mowed down by Resistance; millions of good men and women have bitten the dust before us. And here’s the biggest bitch: We don’t even know what hit us. I never did. From age twenty-four to thirty-two, Resistance kicked my ass from East Coast to West and back again thirteen times and I never even knew it existed. I looked everywhere for the enemy and failed to see it right in front of my face.',\n",

Shift your focus from your mind to the area of your heart, and begin to breathe a little slower than usual, as if your breath is coming from your heart. As you slow your breathing, you are sending a signal to your body in general, and your heart specifically, that you are in a place that is safe and it’s okay to turn your attention inward. This step can be a powerful, stand-alone technique unto itself when you’re feeling overwhelmed by the day’s events or simply desire to be more connected with yourself. It also lays the foundation for Step B as follows. Then, activate a positive feeling. From your heart center, make a sincere attempt to experience a regenerative feeling, such as gratitude, appreciation, or care for someone or something in your life. The key in this step is to first create the feeling to the best of your ability, and then to surrender to the feeling, fully embracing it while allowing it to radiate from your heart to fill your body and permeate your entire being. The following simple steps create the conditions in your body to optimize the harmony, and the coherence, between your heart and your brain.',\n",

Remembering what you’ve been through and how that has strengthened your mindset can lift you out of a negative brain loop and help you bypass those weak, one-second impulses to give in so you can power through obstacles. And when you leverage a calloused mind like I did around the pool that day and keep fighting through pain, it can help you push your limits because if you accept the pain as a natural process and refuse to give in and give up, you will engage the sympathetic nervous system which shifts your hormonal flow. The sympathetic nervous system is your fight or flight reflex. It’s bubbling just below the surface, and when you are lost, stressed out, or struggling, like I was when I was a down and out kid, that’s the part of your mind that’s driving the bus. We’ve all tasted this feeling before. Those mornings when going on a run is the last thing you want to do, but then twenty minutes into it you feel energized, that’s the work of the sympathetic nervous system. What I’ve found is that you can tap into it on call as long as you know how to manage your own mind.',\n",

Don’t just write down your achievement hit list. Include life obstacles you’ve overcome as well, like quitting smoking or overcoming depression or a stutter. Add in those minor tasks you failed earlier in life, but tried again a second or third time and ultimately succeeded at. Feel what it was like to overcome those struggles, those opponents, and win. Then get to work. Set ambitious goals before each workout and let those past victories carry you to new personal bests. If it’s a run or bike ride, include some time to do interval work and challenge yourself to beat your best mile split. Or simply maintain a maximum heart rate for a full minute, then two minutes. If you’re at home, focus on pull-ups or push-ups. Do as many as possible in two minutes. Then try to beat your best. When the pain hits and tries to stop you short of your goal, dunk your fist in, pull out a cookie, and let it fuel you! If you’re more focused on intellectual growth, train yourself to study harder and longer than ever before, or read a record number of books in a given month. Your Cookie Jar can help there too. Because if you perform this challenge correctly and truly challenge yourself, you’ll come to a point in any exercise where pain, boredom, or self-doubt kicks in, and you’ll need to push back to get through it. The Cookie Jar is your shortcut to taking control of your own thought process. Use it that way! The point here isn’t to make yourself feel like a hero for the fuck of it. It’s not a hooray-for-me session. It’s to remember what a badass you are so you can use that energy to succeed again in the heat of battle! Post your memories and the new successes they fueled on social media, and include the hashtags: #canthurtme #cookiejar.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Challenge #1 My bad cards arrived early and stuck around a while, but everyone gets challenged in life at some point. What is your bad hand? What kind of bullshit are you dealing with? Are you getting beaten? Abused? Bullied? Do you ever feel insecure? Maybe your limiting factor is that you are growing up so supported and comfortable, you never push yourself? What are the current factors limiting your growth and success? Is someone standing in your way at work or school? Are you underappreciated and overlooked for opportunities? What are the long odds you’re up against right now? Are you standing in your own way? Break out your journal—if you don’t have one, buy one, or start one on your laptop, tablet, or in the notes app on your smart phone—and write them all out in minute detail. Don’t be bland with this assignment. I showed you every piece of my dirty laundry. If you were hurt or are still in harm’s way, tell the story in full. Give your pain shape. Absorb its power, because you are about to flip that shit. You will use your story, this list of excuses, these very good reasons why you shouldn’t amount to a damn thing, to fuel your ultimate success. Sounds fun right? Yeah, it won’t be. But don’t worry about that yet. We’ll get there. For now, just take inventory. Once you have your list, share it with whoever you want. For some, it may mean logging onto social media, posting a picture, and writing out a few lines about how your own past or present circumstances challenge you to the depth of your soul. If that’s you, use the hashtags #badhand #canthurtme. Otherwise, acknowledge and accept it privately. Whatever works for you. I know it’s hard, but this act alone will begin to empower you to overcome.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Challenge #2 It’s time to come eyeball to eyeball with yourself, and get raw and real. This is not a self-love tactic. You can’t fluff it. Don’t massage your ego. This is about abolishing the ego and taking the first step toward becoming the real you! I tacked Post-It notes on my Accountability Mirror, and I’ll ask you to do the same. Digital devices won’t work. Write all your insecurities, dreams, and goals on Post-Its and tag up your mirror. If you need more education, remind yourself that you need to start working your ass off because you aren’t smart enough! Period, point blank. If you look in the mirror and see someone who is obviously overweight, that means you’re fucking fat! Own it! It’s okay to be unkind with yourself in these moments because we need thicker skin to improve in life. Whether it’s a career goal (quit my job, start a business), a lifestyle goal (lose weight, get more active), or an athletic one (run my first 5K, 10K, or marathon), you need to be truthful with yourself about where you are and the necessary steps it will take to achieve those goals, day by day. Each step, each necessary point of self-improvement, should be written as its own note. That means you have to do some research and break it all down. For example, if you are trying to lose forty pounds, your first Post-It may be to lose two pounds in the first week. Once that goal is achieved, remove the note and post the next goal of two to five pounds until your ultimate goal is realized. Whatever your goal, you’ll need to hold yourself accountable for the small steps it will take to get there. Self-improvement takes dedication and self-discipline. The dirty mirror you see every day is going to reveal the truth. Stop ignoring it. Use it to your advantage. If you feel it, post an image of yourself staring into your tagged-up Accountability Mirror on social media with the hashtags #canthurtme #accountabilitymirror.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Challenge #3 The first step on the journey toward a calloused mind is stepping outside your comfort zone on a regular basis. Dig out your journal again and write down all the things you don’t like to do or that make you uncomfortable. Especially those things you know are good for you. Now go do one of them, and do it again. In the coming pages, I’ll be asking you to mirror what you just read to some degree, but there is no need for you to find your own impossible task and achieve it on the fast track. This is not about changing your life instantly, it’s about moving the needle bit by bit and making those changes sustainable. That means digging down to the micro level and doing something that sucks every day. Even if it’s as simple as making your bed, doing the dishes, ironing your clothes, or getting up before dawn and running two miles each day. Once that becomes comfortable, take it to five, then ten miles. If you already do all those things, find something you aren’t doing. We all have areas in our lives we either ignore or can improve upon. Find yours. We often choose to focus on our strengths rather than our weaknesses. Use this time to make your weaknesses your strengths. Doing things—even small things—that make you uncomfortable will help make you strong. The more often you get uncomfortable the stronger you’ll become, and soon you’ll develop a more productive, can-do dialogue with yourself in stressful situations. Take a photo or video of yourself in the discomfort zone, post it on social media describing what you’re doing and why, and don’t forget to include the hashtags #discomfortzone #pathofmostresistance #canthurtme #impossibletask.',\n",

No matter how they’re treating you there is one way to not only earn their respect, but turn the tables. Excellence. That may mean acing an exam, or crafting an ideal proposal, or smashing a sales goal. Whatever it is, I want you to work harder on that project or in that class than you ever have before. Do everything exactly as they ask, and whatever standard they set as an ideal outcome, you should be aiming to surpass that. If your coach doesn’t give you time in the games, dominate practice. Check the best guy on your squad and show the fuck out. That means putting time in off the field. Watching film so you can study your opponent’s tendencies, memorizing plays, and training in the gym. You need to make that coach pay attention. If it’s your teacher, then start doing work of high quality. Spend extra time on your assignments. Write papers for her that she didn’t even assign! Come early to class. Ask questions. Pay attention. Show her who you are and want to be. If it’s a boss, work around the clock. Get to work before them. Leave after they go home. Make sure they see that shit, and when it’s time to deliver, surpass their maximum expectations. Whoever you’re dealing with, your goal is to make them watch you achieve what they could never have done themselves. You want them thinking how amazing you are.

       "    'text': 'Challenge #5 It’s time to visualize! Again, the average person thinks 2,000–3,000 thoughts per hour. Rather than focusing on bullshit you cannot change, imagine visualizing the things you can. Choose any obstacle in your way, or set a new goal, and visualize overcoming or achieving it. Before I engage in any challenging activity, I start by painting a picture of what my success looks and feels like. I’ll think about it every day and that feeling propels me forward when I’m training, competing, or taking on any task I choose. But visualization isn’t simply about daydreaming of some trophy ceremony—real or metaphorical. You must also visualize the challenges that are likely to arise and determine how you will attack those problems when they do. That way you can be as prepared as possible on the journey. When I show up for a foot race now, I drive the entire course first, visualizing success but also potential challenges, which helps me control my thought process. You can’t prepare for everything but if you engage in strategic visualization ahead of time, you’ll be as prepared as you possibly can be. That also means being prepared to answer the simple questions. Why are you doing this? What is driving you toward this achievement? Where does the darkness you’re using as fuel come from? What has calloused your mind? You’ll need to have those answers at your fingertips when you hit a wall of pain and doubt. To push through, you’ll need to channel your darkness, feed off it, and lean on your calloused mind. Remember, visualization will never compensate for work undone. You cannot visualize lies. All the strategies I employ to answer the simple questions and win the mind game are only effective because I put in the work. It’s a lot more than mind over matter. It takes relentless self-discipline to schedule suffering into your day, every day, but if you do, you’ll find that at the other end of that suffering is a whole other life just waiting for you. This challenge doesn’t have to be physical, and victory doesn’t always mean you came in first place. It can mean you’ve finally overcome a lifelong fear or any other obstacle that made you surrender in the past. Whatever it is, tell the world your story about how you created your #armoredmind and where it’s taken you.',\n",

This will be a three-week challenge. During week one, go about your normal schedule, but take notes. When do you work? Are you working nonstop or checking your phone (the Moment app will tell you)? How long are your meal breaks? When do you exercise, watch TV, or chat to friends? How long is your commute? Are you driving? I want you to get super detailed and document it all with timestamps. This will be your baseline, and you’ll find plenty of fat to trim. Most people waste four to five hours on a given day, and if you can learn to identify and utilize it, you’ll be on your way toward increased productivity. In week two, build an optimal schedule. Lock everything into place in fifteen- to thirty-minute blocks. Some tasks will take multiple blocks or entire days. Fine. When you work, only work on one thing at a time, think about the task in front of you and pursue it relentlessly. When it comes time for the next task on your schedule, place that first one aside, and apply the same focus. Make sure your meal breaks are adequate but not open-ended, and schedule in exercise and rest too. But when it’s time to rest, actually rest. No checking email or bullshitting on social media. If you are going to work hard you must also rest your brain. Make notes with timestamps in week two. You may still find some residual dead space. By week three, you should have a working schedule that maximizes your effort without sacrificing sleep. Post photos of your schedule, with the hashtags #canthurtme #talentnotrequired.',\n",

A lot of people think that once they reach a certain level of status, respect, or success, that they’ve made it in life. I’m here to tell you that you always have to find more. Greatness is not something that if you meet it once it stays with you forever. That shit evaporates like a flash of oil in a hot pan. If you truly want to become uncommon amongst the uncommon, it will require sustaining greatness for a long period of time. It requires staying in constant pursuit and putting out unending effort. This may sound appealing but will require everything you have to give and then some. Believe me, this is not for everyone because it will demand singular focus and may upset the balance in your life. That’s what it takes to become a true overachiever, and if you are already surrounded by people who are at the top of their game, what are you going to do differently to stand out? It’s easy to stand out amongst everyday people and be a big fish in a small pond. It is a much more difficult task when you are a wolf surrounded by wolves.

It means not just graduating BUD/S, but becoming Enlisted Honor Man in Army Ranger School then going out and finishing Badwater.

I want you to feel this process because you are about to file your own, belated After Action Reports. First off, write out all the good things, everything that went well, from your failures. Be detailed and generous with yourself. A lot of good things will have happened. It’s rarely all bad. Then note how you handled your failure. Did it affect your life and your relationships? How so? How did you think throughout the preparation for and during the execution stage of your failure? You have to know how you were thinking at each step because it’s all about mindset, and that’s where most people fall short. Now go back through and make a list of things you can fix. This isn’t time to be soft or generous. Be brutally honest, write them all out. Study them. Then look at your calendar and schedule another attempt as soon as possible. If the failure happened in childhood, and you can’t recreate the Little League all-star game you choked in, I still want you to write that report because you’ll likely be able to use that information to achieve any goal going forward. As you prepare, keep that AAR handy, consult your Accountability Mirror, and make all necessary adjustments. When it comes time to execute, keep everything we’ve learned about the power of a calloused mind, the Cookie Jar, and The 40% Rule in the forefront of your mind. Control your mindset.

For years I’d raged at the world, channeled all my pain from my past and used it as fuel to propel me into the motherfucking stratosphere, but I couldn’t always control the blast radius. Sometimes my rage scorched people who weren’t as strong as I’d become, or didn’t work as hard, and I didn’t swallow my tongue or hide my judgment. I let them know, and that hurt some of the people around me, and it allowed people who didn’t like me to affect my military career.

       "    'text': 'In response, most of us are programmed to seek comfort as a way to numb it all out and cushion the blows. We carve out safe spaces. We consume media that confirms our beliefs, we take up hobbies aligned with our talents, we try to spend as little time as possible doing the tasks we fucking loathe, and that makes us soft. We live a life defined by the limits we imagine and desire for ourselves because it’s comfortable as hell in that box. Not just for us, but for our closest family and friends. The limits we create and accept become the lens through which they see us. Through which they love and appreciate us. But for some, those limits start to feel like bondage, and when we least expect it, our imagination jumps those walls and hunts down dreams that in the immediate aftermath feel attainable. Because most dreams are. We are inspired to make changes little by little, and it hurts. Breaking the shackles and stretching beyond our own perceived limits takes hard fucking work—oftentimes physical work—and when you put yourself on the line, self doubt and pain will greet you with a stinging combination that will buckle your knees. Most people who are merely inspired or motivated will quit at that point, and upon their return, their cells will feel that much smaller, their shackles even tighter. The few who remain outside their walls will encounter even more pain and much more doubt, courtesy of those who we thought were our biggest fans. When it was time for me to lose 106 pounds in less than three months, everyone I talked to told me there was no way I could do it. “Don’t expect too much,” they all said. Their weak-ass dialogue only fed my own self doubt.',\n",

As biofeedback experiments have now confirmed, focusing your attention on an area of the body can cause increased activity in the nerves and muscles in that area. The stronger the focus, the greater the movement of the chi. Keep in mind that you are not pushing or pulling the chi, you are simply shifting your focus to another point. Understanding this is crucial to developing an effective practice.

       "    'text': 'The Taoists, however, noticed that there are actually four stages of erection—four attainments, as they called them. The first is firmness (also referred to as lengthening). The second is swelling. The third is hardness. The fourth is heat. Your erection is not then just a static appendage, but undergoes a process that reflects your level of arousal. Western physicians have recently confirmed these four stages of erection, although describing them in somewhat more technical terms.1 Healing Tao instructor Walter Beckley described the four stages like this: “In the first stage, your penis starts to move and become erect. In the second stage, it’s firm, but not hard—not really hard enough to penetrate (unless you use the Soft Entry technique). In the third stage, it is erect and hard. In the fourth stage, it is stiff and really hot. This last stage is also when your testicles draw into your body. It is much easier to avoid ejaculating when you can remain in the erect and hard third stage. Pulling the sexual energy up helps keep the penis from getting to the final, stiff and hot stage. Relaxing is also essential, as is trying to be aware of when you move into that anxious, explosive fourth stage when ejaculation is imminent.”',\n",

       "    'text': 'One day, as he slept in a cave, he dreamed that he saw his own body sleeping. He came out of the cave on the night of a new moon. The sky was clear, and he could see millions of stars. Then something happened inside of him that transformed his life forever. He looked at his hands, he felt his body, and he heard his own voice say, “I am made of light; I am made of stars.” He looked at the stars again, and he realized that it’s not the stars that create light, but rather light that creates the stars. “Everything is made of light,” he said, “and the space in-between isn’t empty.” And he knew that everything that exists is one living being, and that light is the messenger of life, because it is alive and contains all information. Then he realized that although he was made of stars, he was not those stars. “I am in-between the stars,” he thought. So he called the stars the tonal and the light between the stars the nagual, and he knew that what created the harmony and space between the two is Life or Intent. Without Life, the tonal and the nagual could not exist. Life is the force of the absolute, the supreme, the Creator who creates everything. This is what he discovered: Everything in existence is a manifestation of the one living being we call God. Everything is God. And he came to the conclusion that human perception is merely light perceiving light. He also saw that matter is a mirror — everything is a mirror that reflects light and creates images of that light — and the world of illusion, the Dream, is just like smoke which doesn’t allow us to see what we really are. “The real us is pure love, pure light,” he said.',\n",

The only way to store information is by agreement. The outside dream may hook our attention, but if we don’t agree, we don’t store that information. As soon as we agree, we believe it, and this is called faith. To have faith is to believe unconditionally. That’s how we learn as children. Children believe everything adults say. We agree with them, and our faith is so strong that the belief system controls our whole dream of life. We didn’t choose these beliefs, and we may have rebelled against them, but we were not strong enough to win the rebellion. The result is surrender to the beliefs with our agreement. I call this process the domestication of humans. And through this domestication we learn how to live and how to dream. In human domestication, the information from the outside dream is conveyed to the inside dream, creating our whole belief system.',\n",

We want to be ourselves, but we are very little, and the adults are big and strong. After a certain time we are afraid because we know that every time we do something wrong we are going to be punished.

Tell yourself how much you love yourself. Use the word to break all those teeny, tiny agreements that make you suffer. It is possible. It is possible because I did it, and I am no better than you. No, we are exactly the same. We have the same kind of brain, the same kind of bodies; we are humans. If I was able to break those agreements and create new agreements, then you can do the same. If I can be impeccable with my word, why not you? Just this one agreement can change your whole life. Impeccability of the word can lead you to personal freedom, to huge success and abundance; it can take away all fear and transform it into joy and love.

If you do your best in the search for personal freedom, in the search for self-love, you will discover that it’s just a matter of time before you find what you are looking for.

Respect your body, enjoy your body, love your body, feed, clean, and heal your body. Exercise and do what makes your body feel good.

You can if you want to; if it feels good, do it. Your own body is a manifestation of God, and if you honor your body everything will change for you. When you practice giving love to every part of your body, you plant seeds of love in your mind, and when they grow, you will love, honor, and respect your body immensely. Every action then becomes a ritual in which you are honoring God. After that, the next step is honoring God with every thought, every emotion, every belief, even what is “right” or “wrong.” Every thought becomes a communion with God, and you will live a dream without judgments, victimization, and free of the need to gossip and abuse yourself.',\n",

It is when we lose control that we repress the emotions, not when we are in control. The big difference between a warrior and a victim is that the victim represses, and the warrior refrains. Victims repress because they are afraid to show the emotions, afraid to say what they want to say. To refrain is not the same thing as repression. To refrain is to hold the emotions and to express them in the right moment, not before, not later. That is why warriors are impeccable.

Just as you can say, “I have one hand, and I can shake my other hand and feel the other hand,” the mind can talk to itself. Part of the mind is speaking, and the other part is listening. It is a big problem when a thousand parts of your mind are all speaking at the same time. This is called a mitote, remember? The mitote can be compared to a huge marketplace where thousands of people are talking and bartering at the same time. Each one has different thoughts and feelings; each one has a different point of view. The programming in the mind — all of those agreements we have made — are not necessarily compatible with each other. Every agreement is like a separate living being; it has its own personality and its own voice. There are conflicting agreements that go against other agreements and on and on until it becomes a big war in the mind. The mitote is the reason humans hardly know what they want, how they want it, or when they want it. They don’t agree with themselves because there are parts of the mind that want one thing, and other parts that want exactly the opposite.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Unfortunately, our world doesn’t foster a healthy environment for our brain. Before Jim Kwik provides a road map to become limitless, he indicts the four growing villains that are challenging our capacity to think, focus, learn, grow, and be fully human. The first is digital deluge—the unending flood of information in a world of finite time and unfair expectations that leads to overwhelm, anxiety, and sleeplessness. Drowning in data and rapid change, we long for strategies and tools to regain some semblance of productivity, performance, and peace of mind. The second villain is digital distraction. The fleeting ping of digital dopamine pleasure replaces our ability to sustain the attention necessary for deep relationship, deep learning, or deep work. I recently sat next to a friend at a lecture and noticed her picking up her phone multiple times within a few minutes. I asked for her phone and pulled up the screen time app. She had picked up her phone more than one thousand times and had one thousand notifications in one day. Texts, social media notifications, e-mails, and news alerts, while important in context, can derail our concentration and train us to be distracted from what matters most in the moment. The next villain is digital dementia. Memory is a muscle that we have allowed to atrophy. While there are benefits to having a supercomputer in your pocket, think of it like an electric bicycle. It’s fun and easy but doesn’t get you in shape. Research on dementia proves that the greater our capacity to learn—the more mental “brainercise” we perform—the lower our risk of dementia. In many cases, we have outsourced our memory to our detriment. The last brain-damaging villain is digital deduction. In a world where information is abundantly accessible, we’ve perhaps gone too far in how we use that information, even getting to the point where we are letting technology do much of our critical thinking and reasoning for us. Online, there are so many conclusions being drawn by others that we have begun to surrender our own ability to draw conclusions. We would never let another person do our thinking for us, but we’ve gotten far too comfortable with letting devices have that very power. The cumulative effects of these four digital villains robs us of our focus, attention, learning, and, most importantly, our ability to truly think. It robs us of our mental clarity and results in brain fatigue, distraction, inability to easily learn, and unhappiness. While the technological advances of our time have the potential to both help and harm, the way we use them in our society can lead to an epidemic of overload, memory loss, distraction, and dependency. And it’s only going to get worse.',\n",

If you are not learning or living at your full potential, if there is a gap between your current reality and your desired reality, here’s the reason: There is a limit that must be released and replaced in one of three areas: A limit in your Mindset—you entertain a low belief in yourself, your capabilities, what you deserve, or what is possible. A limit in your Motivation—you lack the drive, purpose, or energy to take action. A limit in your Methods—you were taught and are acting on a process that is not effective to create the results you desire. This applies to an individual, a family, an organization. We all have our own unique story of struggles and strengths. Whatever your situation happens to be, here’s the best part: You’re not alone. I’m going to help you become limitless in your own way, within the three-part framework you’re about to learn: Limitless Mindset, Limitless Motivation, and Limitless Methods. Let me break it down: Mindset (the WHAT): deeply held beliefs, attitudes, and assumptions we create about who we are, how the world works, what we are capable of and deserve, and what is possible. Motivation (the WHY): the purpose one has for taking action. The energy required for someone to behave in a particular way. Method (the HOW): a specific process for accomplishing something, especially an orderly, logical, or systematic way of instruction.',\n",

To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement – which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception. Even though planning is often at odds with the very idea of research and learning, it is the mantra of most study guides and self-help books on academic writing. How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated? It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward.

This doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended to do, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture. Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. The principle is simple but holistic. It is not a quick fix or a fancy tool. It doesn’t do the work for you. But it does provide a structure for our everyday work that deals with the fact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds.',\n",
