And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests.

If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement – which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception. Even though planning is often at odds with the very idea of research and learning, it is the mantra of most study guides and self-help books on academic writing. How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated? It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery – or insight.",0.5151,0.36052,0.32114,0.35104,0.36648,0.5181,0.4849,1.0,0.52514,0.36898,0.41842,0.37438,0.53909,0.31719,0.22669,0.36167,0.52879,0.26189,0.48986,0.23645,0.54134,0.17956,0.31792,0.33082,0.26424,0.29359,0.19443,0.30986,0.29647,0.3784,0.42631,0.33671,0.27815,0.30652,0.45685,0.31532,0.52735,0.30068,0.22119,0.40582,0.34225,0.24055,0.23325,0.42132,0.37905,0.1888,0.28689,0.31354,0.32147,0.35253,0.51636,0.41018,0.24105,0.13676,0.44312,0.59553,0.28226,0.25731,0.34185,0.16842,0.23161,0.24289,0.1625,0.2059,0.36969,0.30753,0.31451,0.29678,0.24626,0.2696,0.23106,0.21222,0.21764,0.34185,0.34716,0.26302,0.19751,0.1448,0.03563,0.02576,0.17186,0.1777,0.17658,0.23087,0.40433,0.40943,0.26704,0.19051,0.38126,0.40362,0.39643,0.41528,0.42464,0.31343,0.28458,0.32499,0.12965,0.27294,0.39113,0.27332,0.22446,0.29427,0.31611,0.37255,0.17785,0.31624,0.43487,0.38193,0.52425,0.38038,0.42936,0.31931,0.27456,0.25642,0.26186,0.19272,0.21822,0.25098,0.33644,0.28624,0.32059,0.2789,0.32884,0.02015,0.40719,0.33587,0.36844,0.36974,0.28907,0.38358,0.42222,0.37136,0.52885,0.48215,0.46089,0.30504,0.30946,0.39082,0.35487,0.32507,0.36897,0.249,0.30753,0.18494,0.21054,0.2156,0.26546,0.17169,0.13488,0.24159,0.22379,0.29843,0.12309,0.11456,0.3974,0.36986,0.36098,0.26461,0.35339,0.28147,0.35467,0.28433,0.24781

Good students wrestle with their sentences because they care about finding the right expression. It takes them longer to find a good idea to write about because they know from experience that the first idea is rarely that great and good questions do not fall into their laps. They spend more time in the library to get a better overview of the literature, which leads to more reading, which means that they have to juggle more information. Having read more does not automatically mean having more ideas.

This doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended to do, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture. Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. The principle is simple but holistic. It is not a quick fix or a fancy tool. It doesn’t do the work for you. But it does provide a structure for our everyday work that deals with the fact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds.",0.42978,0.41981,0.41269,0.22349,0.43092,0.48313,0.40185,0.41842,0.27786,0.52123,1.0,0.48844,0.38663,0.26439,0.30921,0.34754,0.40753,0.27343,0.49343,0.2603,0.4297,0.25261,0.40954,0.31281,0.32866,0.35991,0.14213,0.26091,0.21242,0.36316,0.36436,0.33911,0.28993,0.16454,0.35886,0.29175,0.37876,0.3275,0.3163,0.3199,0.34329,0.27868,0.36347,0.35925,0.33852,0.11541,0.22379,0.25397,0.23886,0.25274,0.39227,0.38413,0.21248,0.19237,0.26586,0.47388,0.16289,0.26783,0.29568,0.16543,0.23537,0.25222,0.14959,0.24479,0.23712,0.30258,0.24511,0.28056,0.23071,0.27155,0.2598,0.1615,0.19409,0.29568,0.29614,0.22392,0.26031,0.14905,0.06626,0.00928,0.1788,0.21548,0.18091,0.16163,0.36593,0.32838,0.27172,0.15585,0.30119,0.30707,0.33117,0.39282,0.38309,0.38092,0.29341,0.3841,0.12002,0.35228,0.35394,0.29511,0.25441,0.29914,0.27521,0.34489,0.2614,0.35789,0.32655,0.42319,0.41891,0.35069,0.38345,0.30194,0.19103,0.24317,0.21003,0.14391,0.23884,0.24825,0.25375,0.30703,0.37317,0.23801,0.22399,0.15847,0.28395,0.25124,0.251,0.29073,0.17247,0.35569,0.32657,0.44029,0.48756,0.47764,0.38953,0.25999,0.2165,0.35816,0.35699,0.35744,0.35352,0.22752,0.30258,0.27689,0.25664,0.30804,0.26477,0.1515,0.12953,0.21271,0.16868,0.23432,0.16789,0.20833,0.33023,0.2694,0.28018,0.26039,0.24777,0.24679,0.30852,0.27836,0.26212

336303826,16218235,Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential,Tiago Forte,"Robert Darnton explains the role of commonplace books: Unlike modern readers, who follow the flow of a narrative from beginning to end, early modern Englishmen read in fits and starts and jumped from book to book. They broke texts into fragments and assembled them into new patterns by transcribing them in different sections of their notebooks. Then they reread the copies and rearranged the patterns while adding more excerpts. Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality.III Commonplace books were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from different sources and to inspire their own thinking.",0.05918,0.06208,0.01729,0.33987,0.14523,0.10924,0.20608,0.19443,0.21501,0.01886,0.14213,0.11268,0.12064,0.18822,0.07787,0.25421,0.33509,0.1812,0.1474,0.08771,0.15271,0.21357,0.19458,0.22105,0.14428,0.18455,1.0,0.32454,0.1737,0.25389,0.30915,0.22404,0.09945,0.29712,0.38369,0.1523,0.27533,0.11549,0.16445,0.20094,0.1564,0.23596,0.07346,0.2591,0.20119,0.23126,0.32038,0.33958,0.24121,0.2166,0.17033,0.12906,0.25313,0.03284,0.13215,0.23492,0.11759,0.17532,0.1462,0.06996,0.19967,0.07781,0.15557,0.04137,0.21527,0.1577,0.16825,0.11488,0.2439,0.20862,0.09638,0.30957,0.21708,0.1462,0.21208,0.2543,0.14689,0.16251,0.01878,0.08865,0.13038,0.07745,0.22018,0.05587,0.45145,0.19605,0.16703,0.16145,0.29279,0.11201,0.08347,0.15654,0.23774,0.22482,0.1436,0.16725,0.05273,0.13019,0.17638,0.17556,0.11414,0.05885,0.13296,0.11728,0.15243,0.05283,0.13125,0.22545,0.17341,0.0675,0.08044,-0.05058,0.03725,0.15505,-0.00547,0.1557,0.07261,-0.00077,-0.04037,0.05314,0.04403,0.13295,0.2405,0.13308,0.2427,0.06526,0.0733,-0.02613,-0.03457,-0.01948,0.04957,0.03196,0.22397,0.17483,0.15771,0.08109,0.16307,-0.00632,0.09014,0.11484,0.13562,0.00378,0.1577,0.12841,0.10299,0.08909,0.18747,0.07305,0.07072,0.21865,0.18281,0.19422,0.1348,0.21749,0.22998,0.1903,0.28188,0.21875,0.23044,0.18521,0.15543,0.16932,0.2218

So much of our intellectual output—from brainstorms to photos to planning to research—all too often is left stranded on hard drives or lost somewhere in the cloud. I believe that we have reached an inflection point, where technology has become sufficiently advanced and user-friendly that we can integrate it with our biological brains. Computers have become smaller, more powerful, and more intuitive, to the point that they are unmistakably an essential component of how we think.

Discoverability is an idea from information science that refers to “the degree to which a piece of content or information can be found in a search of a file, database, or other information system.”I Librarians think about discoverability when deciding how to lay out books on the shelves.

Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas. It is a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your changing needs over time. In school or courses you take, it can be used to take notes for studying. At work, it can help you organize your projects. At home, it can help you manage your household. However you decide to use it, your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case.

Ideas are merely thoughts until you put them into action. Thoughts are fleeting, quickly fading as time passes. To truly make an idea stick, you have to engage with it. You have to get your hands dirty and apply that knowledge to a practical problem. We learn by making concrete things—before we feel ready, before we have it completely figured out, and before we know where it’s going.

376433768,16218235,Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential,Tiago Forte,"The opposite of a Scarcity Mindset is an Abundance Mindset. This is a way of looking at the world as full of valuable and helpful things—ideas, insights, tools, collaborations, opportunities. An Abundance Mindset tells us that there is an endless amount of incredibly powerful knowledge everywhere we look—in the content we consume, in our social network, in our bodies and intuitions, and in our own minds. It also tells us that we don’t need to consume or understand all of it, or even much of it. All we need is a few seeds of wisdom, and the seeds we most need tend to continually find us again and again. You don’t need to go out and hunt down insights. All you have to do is listen to what life is repeatedly trying to tell you. Life tends to surface exactly what we need to know, whether we like it or not.",0.29165,0.14902,0.37383,0.14449,0.39795,0.35148,0.13788,0.30068,0.17286,0.23355,0.3275,0.33028,0.27768,0.27218,0.17134,0.51006,0.36598,0.3325,0.36065,0.27219,0.46791,0.14165,0.40276,0.25962,0.20199,0.35777,0.11549,0.08208,0.51283,0.34763,0.25231,0.35162,0.26285,0.15826,0.33552,0.22492,0.46434,1.0,0.79644,0.22964,0.30208,0.10129,0.31921,0.21777,0.356,0.03218,0.06161,0.1312,0.30148,0.22657,0.21614,0.32282,0.06373,0.12539,0.0803,0.42548,0.10485,0.38056,0.35043,0.20404,0.24504,0.21584,0.15879,0.2689,0.4814,0.31269,0.34292,0.28555,0.21074,0.28233,0.29483,0.23145,0.25537,0.35043,0.48281,0.39737,0.20161,0.13757,0.08006,0.06899,0.1999,0.22686,0.18261,0.31013,0.35468,0.51281,0.39249,0.36084,0.37067,0.27473,0.24009,0.30328,0.47405,0.33088,0.33227,0.44948,0.12668,0.33958,0.35718,0.16918,0.2119,0.19901,0.21196,0.31951,0.16849,0.2506,0.21013,0.2309,0.25788,0.29861,0.26091,0.1235,0.18291,0.1199,0.12725,0.06159,0.04324,0.06223,0.15093,0.14634,0.35347,0.16964,0.40962,0.02546,0.26755,0.14733,0.1142,0.06551,0.03578,0.15904,0.17087,0.28759,0.21053,0.26994,0.2073,0.15647,0.09151,0.14829,0.25086,0.23882,0.33576,0.14296,0.31269,0.3397,0.21081,0.27327,0.20345,0.17178,0.10684,0.29198,0.28735,0.28749,0.23398,0.3156,0.35438,0.27493,0.33224,0.43456,0.32618,0.40737,0.30376,0.27738,0.27487

Moreover, this new learned knowledge can provide more possible connections for new information. If you focus your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn. But if you focus your time and energy on learning without trying to understand, you will not only not understand, but also probably not learn. And the effects are cumulative.

We have to elaborate on what we read just to be able to write it down and translate it into different contexts.",0.20906,0.19069,0.12358,0.30119,0.32373,0.28512,0.32739,0.31354,0.32969,0.13963,0.25397,0.19086,0.22103,0.17219,0.23165,0.23726,0.42635,0.17728,0.28661,0.20169,0.24739,0.13208,0.23418,0.19641,0.19229,0.27071,0.33958,0.33612,0.22522,0.33041,0.38833,0.27138,0.24016,0.26744,0.40098,0.10168,0.26556,0.1312,0.08615,0.16935,0.2773,0.19139,0.18876,0.74288,0.3799,0.17427,0.42623,1.0,0.13085,0.14132,0.27652,0.29043,0.27976,0.23881,0.2064,0.30748,0.18689,0.27709,0.28819,0.16385,0.29199,0.10822,0.19572,0.18456,0.20756,0.24796,0.21461,0.19777,0.33033,0.30453,0.23042,0.21508,0.27379,0.28819,0.26744,0.22676,0.22492,0.19118,0.06994,0.08292,0.19506,0.25921,0.25203,0.17421,0.40878,0.29188,0.21037,0.1668,0.32228,0.21132,0.22606,0.33333,0.26388,0.29711,0.24298,0.28193,0.12125,0.23891,0.29284,0.24801,0.1747,0.1561,0.19365,0.26373,0.18775,0.0969,0.12411,0.31525,0.24772,0.20289,0.08304,0.06799,0.07438,0.22425,0.04215,0.17392,0.0596,-0.02539,-0.04352,0.05839,0.10916,0.12066,0.17384,0.12648,0.26365,-0.00309,0.02323,-0.08656,-0.03256,0.03239,-0.01402,0.16012,0.2659,0.24271,0.14984,0.13432,0.2463,0.00671,0.11884,0.20991,0.23649,0.15567,0.24796,0.19312,0.13736,0.13574,0.23223,0.13604,0.14718,0.21654,0.10939,0.20304,0.23215,0.14902,0.24037,0.24278,0.32529,0.2459,0.29692,0.26422,0.32523,0.292,0.28588

In the next couple of chapters, I’ll show you how the practice of creating a Second Brain is part of a long legacy of thinkers and creators who came before us—writers, scientists, philosophers, leaders, and everyday people who strived to remember and achieve more. Then I’ll introduce you to a few basic principles and tools you’ll need to set yourself up to succeed.

481016835,16218235,Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential,Tiago Forte,"Watson and Crick’s breakthrough is well recognized, but there is a part of their story that is much less well known. An important tool of the researchers was building physical models, an approach they borrowed from American biochemist Linus Pauling. They made cardboard cutouts to approximate the shapes of the molecules they knew were part of DNA’s makeup and, like a puzzle, experimented with different ways of putting them together. They would shift around their models on their desktops, trying to find a shape that fit everything they knew about how the molecules were arranged.",0.10556,0.08591,0.08627,0.06157,0.25016,0.13078,0.1792,0.28226,0.16371,0.13575,0.16289,0.164,0.06581,0.11776,0.08585,0.04993,0.22154,0.11448,0.18997,0.14003,0.14263,0.13535,0.08824,0.10882,0.13453,0.13731,0.11759,0.15816,0.08749,0.27395,0.23695,0.15117,0.12631,0.2104,0.25186,0.07288,0.27306,0.10485,0.03012,0.25913,0.15886,0.13815,0.03688,0.23685,0.20898,0.13098,0.26225,0.18689,0.07692,0.06746,0.15502,0.2529,0.09809,0.09269,0.13297,0.22427,1.0,0.13268,0.21575,0.25252,0.19005,0.09071,0.20381,0.32629,0.24332,0.33898,0.26798,0.31069,0.25353,0.24931,0.37434,0.28718,0.35771,0.21575,0.23386,0.22565,0.27832,0.09435,0.03171,-0.01294,0.24055,0.46037,0.38647,0.16011,0.21991,0.26275,0.17328,0.18473,0.2351,0.17948,0.17386,0.23546,0.23463,0.16269,0.22344,0.24315,0.17731,0.10226,0.27001,0.16851,0.06196,0.1001,0.13608,0.11547,0.10297,0.0859,0.06948,0.16453,0.12627,0.10174,0.07778,0.12992,0.02048,0.06624,0.05869,0.06465,0.05145,0.0827,0.06086,0.00244,0.05457,0.00978,0.12029,-0.00114,0.08482,0.07922,0.01635,0.04113,0.04934,0.06571,0.0589,0.03399,0.14656,0.10532,0.09756,0.01454,0.10294,0.00144,-0.00989,0.09389,0.15898,0.1229,0.33898,0.21483,0.21037,0.21446,0.3787,0.48216,0.14663,0.27083,0.15365,0.35802,0.17058,0.1559,0.2197,0.20879,0.29527,0.21083,0.32359,0.3175,0.12392,0.2433,0.17847
496905538,16218235,Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential,Tiago Forte,"Information isn’t a luxury—it is the very basis of our survival. Just as with the food we put into our bodies, it is our responsibility and right to choose our information diet. It’s up to us to decide what information is good for us, what we want more of and less of, and ultimately, what we do with it. You are what you consume, and that applies just as much to information as to nutrition. A Second Brain gives us a way to filter the information stream and curate only the very best ideas we encounter in a private, trusted place. Think of it as planting your own “knowledge garden” where you are free to cultivate your ideas and develop your own thinking away from the deafening noise of other people’s opinions.",0.233,0.16551,0.18971,0.28323,0.38349,0.31411,0.24234,0.25731,0.19703,0.16211,0.26783,0.20591,0.19676,0.48426,0.16265,0.53962,0.3761,0.3076,0.60786,0.83074,0.40052,0.13792,0.27515,0.38331,0.26122,0.49662,0.17532,0.19048,0.38802,0.51493,0.50711,0.44758,0.78975,0.16994,0.52975,0.22449,0.32713,0.38056,0.35417,0.39359,0.75724,0.18856,0.5186,0.36263,0.34678,0.102,0.23122,0.27709,0.27788,0.21759,0.22685,0.66761,0.1086,0.18118,0.13857,0.43494,0.13268,1.0,0.33071,0.24875,0.53257,0.20673,0.26615,0.2637,0.36461,0.28559,0.263,0.29982,0.34453,0.31092,0.33293,0.3347,0.39986,0.33071,0.38822,0.38958,0.28928,0.27174,0.1196,0.23627,0.29128,0.31032,0.32851,0.27155,0.67556,0.3753,0.4985,0.29166,0.39173,0.37068,0.34765,0.3154,0.40492,0.47982,0.54377,0.50485,0.26074,0.32612,0.44304,0.16564,0.22634,0.07638,0.20932,0.22277,0.16806,0.16769,0.11836,0.30362,0.20252,0.28642,0.17672,0.1077,0.07126,0.13824,0.00859,0.09133,0.02256,-0.01995,-0.00807,0.02568,0.11695,0.13182,0.27502,0.04473,0.26694,0.08204,0.07421,-0.01592,-0.02086,0.06832,0.08174,0.20483,0.16706,0.17693,0.14178,0.11125,0.15196,0.07794,0.13191,0.24611,0.31601,0.1308,0.28559,0.33807,0.22958,0.16805,0.21013,0.24455,0.02645,0.25568,0.15188,0.26469,0.17237,0.22018,0.31909,0.26542,0.32068,0.3954,0.27834,0.33017,0.29209,0.41671,0.39851

Meaning emerges when a message reaches a life-form or a machine with the ability to process information;",0.18429,0.23703,0.22646,0.26906,0.42692,0.23375,0.25108,0.2696,0.13483,0.23026,0.27155,0.20871,0.181,0.15493,0.21014,0.37035,0.44236,0.28407,0.31995,0.20774,0.22933,0.08873,0.33878,0.34735,0.26351,0.29233,0.20862,0.32367,0.30068,0.53379,0.45222,0.45235,0.26653,0.34241,0.42887,0.20042,0.37181,0.28233,0.24944,0.3404,0.29908,0.19858,0.21265,0.42069,0.30234,0.13131,0.35652,0.30453,0.24249,0.25257,0.18923,0.46806,0.26979,0.17258,0.11522,0.41403,0.24931,0.31092,0.44428,0.39386,0.57865,0.27285,0.77078,0.37739,0.38217,0.46778,0.34838,0.35565,0.5997,1.0,0.45289,0.43607,0.56246,0.44428,0.4522,0.42721,0.44806,0.43424,0.18635,0.28032,0.38976,0.52464,0.70747,0.33734,0.42441,0.4214,0.3879,0.32084,0.45557,0.29796,0.31807,0.43643,0.3945,0.38808,0.31865,0.46319,0.28191,0.20971,0.43456,0.29244,0.21312,0.19486,0.26331,0.24841,0.22745,0.23072,0.16304,0.37031,0.34267,0.30713,0.15538,0.10449,0.0908,0.24346,0.11441,0.27651,0.11991,0.11255,0.16365,0.19868,0.17111,0.15314,0.20573,0.18265,0.36655,0.1031,0.04328,0.07996,0.05686,0.0651,0.08355,0.19602,0.25963,0.20954,0.237,0.20218,0.1442,0.04185,0.10496,0.25753,0.31575,0.21727,0.46778,0.4159,0.28753,0.24233,0.33613,0.53459,0.22361,0.43882,0.22391,0.40582,0.14258,0.31193,0.34672,0.29319,0.4441,0.47678,0.47087,0.45672,0.27726,0.40613,0.35675

The difference between the world where Iris was born and the world of early hominids resides not in the physicality of matter but in the way in which matter is arranged. That physical order is information. Iris’ nighttime delivery was facilitated not by objects, but by the information embodied in these objects and by the practical uses of knowledge and knowhow that these objects implicitly carry. Her nighttime delivery was illuminated not just by light bulbs but by the understanding of electricity, energy, and materials embodied in those light bulbs. Iris was kept warm that night not by a random collection of threads but by blankets that wove together matter, knowledge, and imagination. Paradoxically, Iris was born into a nonfictional world that, although tangible, is made of fiction.

The finiteness of humans and of the networks we form limits our ability to accumulate and transmit knowledge and knowhow, leading to spatial accumulations of knowledge and knowhow that result in global inequality.",0.20276,0.1984,0.31453,0.24644,0.46737,0.26143,0.25466,0.34716,0.20976,0.37526,0.29614,0.35722,0.21357,0.28489,0.15461,0.42234,0.50606,0.4556,0.39991,0.25702,0.36824,0.15807,0.38905,0.42876,0.30144,0.36109,0.21208,0.22188,0.46487,0.48929,0.45974,0.51844,0.31392,0.27113,0.49748,0.27158,0.52584,0.48281,0.39118,0.38446,0.36022,0.19166,0.2715,0.39381,0.35146,0.1485,0.33038,0.26744,0.38833,0.21281,0.33586,0.45533,0.15057,0.09427,0.1346,0.48072,0.23386,0.38822,0.61889,0.34726,0.49551,0.53472,0.3503,0.3777,0.66623,0.49352,0.68126,0.43415,0.5142,0.4522,0.4653,0.4123,0.51078,0.61889,1.0,0.76089,0.37753,0.2771,0.13602,0.17901,0.35543,0.35451,0.45388,0.44735,0.47664,0.6011,0.59082,0.45476,0.60305,0.3429,0.34376,0.45032,0.62276,0.51992,0.48756,0.66189,0.14582,0.24479,0.48163,0.18978,0.11536,0.14177,0.1922,0.25242,0.19588,0.33316,0.21604,0.40616,0.40553,0.28885,0.15004,0.14183,0.12222,0.15657,0.09359,0.0357,0.03961,0.07782,0.11398,0.24843,0.26262,0.16673,0.32466,0.09525,0.42082,0.09313,0.05589,0.02603,0.00467,0.08098,0.08848,0.16842,0.2848,0.25863,0.2522,0.21652,0.2709,0.12397,0.20967,0.3009,0.39449,0.21255,0.49352,0.46673,0.34985,0.34755,0.33069,0.33662,0.20253,0.4011,0.4879,0.40434,0.19315,0.26461,0.38119,0.32185,0.53078,0.8042,0.61463,0.63018,0.49785,0.5581,0.60245

From this fundamental perspective we will describe the economy as the system by which people accumulate knowledge and knowhow to create packets of physical order, or products, that augment our capacity to accumulate more knowledge and knowhow and, in turn, accumulate more information. We will focus largely on the growth of information, knowledge, and knowhow in the economy by first creating a theory of products in terms of physical order and then explaining the social and economic mechanisms that enable our society to accumulate the knowledge and knowhow we need to produce products.",0.12235,0.22054,0.21666,0.21975,0.27518,0.1636,0.2353,0.26302,0.14313,0.32034,0.22392,0.32435,0.14225,0.23431,0.05697,0.3972,0.4962,0.44027,0.32486,0.21903,0.2419,0.19787,0.31565,0.59694,0.33108,0.3115,0.2543,0.26486,0.35105,0.42871,0.37041,0.49667,0.23988,0.37428,0.43366,0.18677,0.44639,0.39737,0.34053,0.31324,0.27956,0.22673,0.17845,0.33544,0.28809,0.22147,0.26971,0.22676,0.36449,0.16518,0.27019,0.34103,0.21725,0.05415,0.20467,0.36622,0.22565,0.38958,0.4884,0.465,0.46732,0.43831,0.33431,0.47822,0.61435,0.58256,0.6066,0.52712,0.58719,0.42721,0.57009,0.4106,0.51987,0.4884,0.76089,1.0,0.48534,0.41674,0.22854,0.33772,0.51822,0.36112,0.48078,0.48152,0.42002,0.44727,0.41512,0.30728,0.43598,0.24418,0.27417,0.37055,0.55745,0.35691,0.32204,0.55721,0.05605,0.12551,0.37653,0.213,0.09283,0.11244,0.18839,0.24464,0.22287,0.26869,0.20984,0.46515,0.42949,0.27263,0.13366,0.12904,0.13676,0.23086,0.09453,0.1877,0.12855,0.12662,0.12973,0.19509,0.12929,0.15166,0.36444,0.10254,0.4164,0.08724,0.05149,0.03747,0.02624,0.07009,0.06107,0.11101,0.24934,0.27124,0.28078,0.18875,0.32099,0.13356,0.19503,0.30651,0.3819,0.11113,0.58256,0.58682,0.44397,0.41973,0.39942,0.42538,0.18373,0.5064,0.47978,0.4832,0.23765,0.34678,0.37152,0.28243,0.5142,0.86711,0.54763,0.63187,0.36634,0.39684,0.45005

One searchable, always accessible, easily shared and embedded amongst the digital text we consume.”6 This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas. It is a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your changing needs over time. In school or courses you take, it can be used to take notes for studying. At work, it can help you organize your projects. At home, it can help you manage your household. However you decide to use it, your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solitude before sharing it with others.",0.31313,0.18954,0.30833,0.46521,0.49681,0.41234,0.3325,0.40433,0.31784,0.25076,0.36593,0.32681,0.29828,0.41249,0.28035,0.51761,0.62136,0.48288,0.71961,0.60672,0.56424,0.35332,0.42853,0.39284,0.39304,0.51521,0.45145,0.44468,0.36202,0.73684,0.68245,0.64326,0.61429,0.43336,0.91072,0.35015,0.49357,0.35468,0.31653,0.50077,0.69406,0.2818,0.42671,0.47701,0.32937,0.17745,0.4304,0.40878,0.47192,0.3854,0.41913,0.71318,0.34459,0.30691,0.29899,0.57761,0.21991,0.67556,0.46232,0.20653,0.49309,0.24593,0.2948,0.2971,0.43337,0.33675,0.40798,0.25093,0.43572,0.42441,0.36668,0.40578,0.44534,0.46232,0.47664,0.42002,0.31237,0.21071,0.03251,0.08478,0.23022,0.30804,0.34415,0.27359,1.0,0.45769,0.49438,0.24344,0.39292,0.34104,0.35539,0.33588,0.49056,0.45516,0.49573,0.56729,0.22259,0.29688,0.36494,0.35468,0.20663,0.18974,0.34761,0.32169,0.39635,0.23329,0.37175,0.45425,0.4371,0.29743,0.23121,0.21154,0.17071,0.38085,0.15859,0.299,0.14581,0.08818,0.10627,0.1733,0.23482,0.25351,0.4664,0.22566,0.42367,0.23689,0.22285,0.09906,0.0643,0.18104,0.20198,0.22484,0.43088,0.43801,0.38361,0.25572,0.19478,0.17912,0.22834,0.3709,0.38056,0.2686,0.33675,0.3345,0.19082,0.1841,0.27585,0.27847,0.08235,0.3422,0.28198,0.33473,0.15705,0.25278,0.42902,0.36435,0.53936,0.46212,0.45576,0.40243,0.38975,0.4369,0.42372

To function, individuals rely not only on knowledge stored within our skulls but also on knowledge stored elsewhere: in our bodies, in the environment, and especially in other people.

Even the simplest objects require complex webs of knowledge to manufacture and use.

Most people can’t tell you how a coffeemaker works, how glue holds paper together, or how the focus works on a camera, let alone something as complex as love. Our point is not that people are ignorant. It’s that people are more ignorant than they think they are.

And we all have domains in which we are experts, in which we know a lot in exquisite detail. But on most subjects, we connect only abstract bits of information, and what we know is little more than a feeling of understanding we can’t really unpack. In fact, most knowledge is little more than a bunch of associations, high-level links between objects or people that aren’t broken down into detailed stories. So why don’t we realize the depth of our ignorance? Why do we think we understand things deeply, that we have systematic webs of knowledge that make sense of everything, when the reality is so different?

From the beginning of civilization, people have developed distinctive expertise within their group, clan, or society. They have become the local expert on agriculture, medicine, manufacturing, navigating, music, storytelling, cooking, hunting, fighting, or one of many other specialties. One individual may have some expertise in more than one skill, perhaps several, but never all, and never in every aspect of any one thing. No chef can cook all dishes. Though some are mighty impressive, no musician can play every instrument or every type of music. No one has ever been able to do everything. So we collaborate. That’s a major benefit of living in social groups, to make it easy to share our skills and knowledge.

Human beings don’t merely make individual contributions to a project, like machines operating in an assembly line. Rather, we are able to work together, aware of others and what they are trying to accomplish. We pay attention together and we share goals. In the language of cognitive science, we share intentionality. This is a form of collaboration that you don’t see in other animals. We actually enjoy sharing our mind space with others. In one form, it’s called playing. Our skulls may delimit the frontier of our brains, but they do not delimit the frontier of our knowledge. The mind stretches beyond the brain to include the body, the environment, and people other than oneself, so the study of the mind cannot be reduced to the study of the brain.

583516125,31385202,The Knowledge Illusion: The myth of individual thought and the power of collective wisdom,Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach,"What is true of face perception is true of all perception. Being smart is all about having the ability to extract deeper, more abstract information from the flood of data that comes into our senses. Instead of just reacting to the light, sounds, and smells that surround them, animals with sophisticated large brains respond to deep, abstract properties of the world that they are sensing. This allows them to detect extraordinarily subtle and complex similarities and differences in new situations that allow them to act effectively, even in situations they’ve never encountered before. The reason that deeper, more abstract information is helpful is that it can be used to pick out what we’re interested in from an incredibly complex array of possibilities, regardless of how the focus of our interest presents itself. We make use of abstract information to, for example, recognize familiar melodies. Once you’ve heard Brahms’s Lullaby, you can recognize it no matter what key it’s played in or what instrument it’s played on, even if it’s played with several errors. Whatever it is that allows us to recognize a familiar tune, it is not a memory of the specific event of hearing that tune in the past. It must be something quite abstract. We rely on this abstract information to recognize stuff all the time, and we’re not even aware that we’re doing so.",0.11156,-0.01238,0.13584,0.04505,0.33268,0.11116,0.0932,0.12965,0.06581,0.03564,0.12002,0.04799,0.01786,0.23835,0.15714,0.09363,0.11118,0.09283,0.24431,0.23167,0.15055,0.02798,0.09712,0.05705,0.0961,0.27763,0.05273,0.13259,0.15255,0.22553,0.30432,0.12088,0.31778,0.03729,0.1739,0.11467,0.16584,0.12668,0.09235,0.25696,0.30198,0.13651,0.22263,0.20208,0.21747,0.00317,0.17009,0.12125,0.12895,0.10846,0.07053,0.2939,0.05271,0.20205,0.01364,0.19608,0.17731,0.26074,0.24406,0.11373,0.38071,0.02275,0.26751,0.07624,0.15921,0.12633,0.1155,0.11064,0.16304,0.28191,0.11773,0.28346,0.31051,0.24406,0.14582,0.05605,0.14255,0.09721,0.06934,0.08761,0.12853,0.28797,0.26447,0.02291,0.22259,0.24235,0.30838,0.27077,0.29622,0.20179,0.22283,0.29432,0.12583,0.33908,0.32435,0.22241,1.0,0.2455,0.36257,0.03729,0.06135,0.05209,0.06138,0.06624,0.03611,0.0197,-0.00383,0.07474,0.03461,0.17085,0.15455,0.07276,0.03108,0.01669,0.10082,0.04417,0.03362,0.00743,0.01432,0.05157,0.09233,0.07117,0.02849,0.015,0.0316,0.09159,0.04165,0.00495,0.02339,0.04466,0.0283,0.03602,0.06976,0.03807,0.05317,0.04449,0.04107,0.02373,0.06432,0.05186,0.13282,0.04973,0.12633,0.09544,0.0826,-0.00277,0.11332,0.19954,0.12977,0.18231,0.07788,0.15945,0.02825,0.13429,0.14042,0.11203,0.14149,0.09632,0.21238,0.06537,0.19204,0.38969,0.3458

Remembering everything gets in the way of focusing on the deeper principles that allow us to recognize how a new situation resembles past situations and what kinds of actions will be effective.,0.34796,0.1551,0.26889,0.16556,0.35861,0.4087,0.24583,0.27294,0.14472,0.18459,0.35228,0.15706,0.2168,0.31278,0.41884,0.4094,0.35477,0.2457,0.32638,0.26941,0.33626,0.14645,0.1776,0.21274,0.20253,0.51643,0.13019,0.18849,0.27371,0.36099,0.38406,0.25258,0.26829,0.15019,0.25016,0.11105,0.24011,0.33958,0.31003,0.26419,0.28652,0.1027,0.38612,0.29319,0.33048,0.08291,0.1982,0.23891,0.17375,0.2238,0.30743,0.31193,0.19179,0.40736,0.18728,0.33637,0.10226,0.32612,0.26368,0.20648,0.39478,0.13608,0.14892,0.21133,0.18638,0.21025,0.1653,0.24093,0.21889,0.20971,0.24891,0.18712,0.26968,0.26368,0.24479,0.12551,0.18126,0.14095,0.18212,0.08822,0.2076,0.23145,0.19924,0.22146,0.29688,0.41246,0.35977,0.18481,0.36658,0.31038,0.39146,0.34006,0.26281,0.31955,0.26979,0.2927,0.2455,1.0,0.48184,0.16373,0.16423,0.17484,0.12355,0.26705,0.27208,0.20279,0.16942,0.3007,0.18693,0.28959,0.312,0.12922,0.14867,0.13975,0.07568,0.10233,-0.00062,0.06774,0.0403,0.11766,0.2762,0.13641,0.20443,0.02331,0.16331,0.09969,0.04596,0.07604,0.07433,0.17232,0.12467,0.20343,0.18315,0.26169,0.21033,0.12372,0.21965,0.1349,0.2138,0.24846,0.19407,0.0897,0.21025,0.15596,0.21756,0.15369,0.14662,0.21365,0.22288,0.20752,0.07353,0.20516,0.13385,0.17276,0.24332,0.22149,0.22437,0.14819,0.23506,0.28555,0.30014,0.34051,0.24834
583516127,31385202,The Knowledge Illusion: The myth of individual thought and the power of collective wisdom,Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach,"Namely, the mind evolved to support our ability to act effectively. Thinking beings were more likely to survive than their competitors because they were more likely to take actions that benefited them in the short run and the long run. This has important implications for how we should understand the shape of thought. As brains get more complex, they get better at responding to deeper, more abstract cues from the environment, and this makes them ever more adaptive to new situations. This is critical to understanding the knowledge illusion: Storing details is often unnecessary to act effectively; a broad picture is generally all we need. Sometimes storing details is counterproductive, as in the case of hyperthymesics and Funes the Memorious. If we had evolved in an environment that favored other kinds of capacities rather than the ability to choose effective actions, the human mind would probably follow a different kind of logic than it does. If we evolved in a world that rewarded gambling on games of chance, we would probably be able to reason flawlessly about probability distributions and the laws of statistics. If we evolved in a world that rewarded deductive reasoning, we would probably all be like Spock, masterful at deducing conclusions. But most of us are miserable at both these things. Instead, we evolved in a world ruled by the logic of action, and that is why this kind of thought is so central to what makes us human. In the next chapter we will explain in more detail what the logic of action is and how it differs from other kinds of logic.",0.32794,0.22814,0.2729,0.26316,0.51543,0.37019,0.28518,0.39113,0.23362,0.19586,0.35394,0.23069,0.28178,0.3997,0.23196,0.3785,0.3677,0.2375,0.41003,0.36479,0.4374,0.05517,0.271,0.26435,0.19086,0.43991,0.17638,0.16212,0.32354,0.42661,0.48899,0.28425,0.42998,0.07175,0.33236,0.24074,0.41875,0.35718,0.33603,0.47064,0.43263,0.1519,0.30664,0.37587,0.41577,0.08397,0.24172,0.29284,0.24415,0.24181,0.23607,0.47524,0.09897,0.18951,0.09798,0.52384,0.27001,0.44304,0.46702,0.26284,0.48161,0.22686,0.35828,0.3321,0.49312,0.41181,0.39043,0.41168,0.38219,0.43456,0.36866,0.3846,0.47431,0.46702,0.48163,0.37653,0.30953,0.20554,0.16495,0.19147,0.30501,0.36932,0.42299,0.28068,0.36494,0.49592,0.52412,0.35323,0.52912,0.70392,0.67323,0.48227,0.43244,0.54895,0.50989,0.50326,0.36257,0.48184,1.0,0.12129,0.16988,0.16733,0.18738,0.20251,0.12058,0.24308,0.13056,0.27638,0.27044,0.31164,0.27624,0.12202,0.10884,0.10629,0.07943,0.03204,0.05575,0.09865,0.03796,0.13127,0.26591,0.08051,0.12556,-0.00323,0.21474,0.08866,0.09302,0.07946,0.05795,0.13957,0.1595,0.25481,0.23237,0.21343,0.17743,0.13627,0.18487,0.11316,0.17204,0.2307,0.33692,0.11337,0.41181,0.3334,0.33642,0.30318,0.3264,0.38391,0.25427,0.37442,0.28412,0.36989,0.14635,0.27918,0.38672,0.37009,0.38998,0.39172,0.38589,0.39601,0.31787,0.50393,0.42244

Does either description below sound familiar? “Project people” are good at sprints. Give them a clear goal and a path to get there, and they will ferociously chase after it with everything they have. The weakness of sprinters is that once they’ve reached their goal, they will often have trouble keeping it going. Sprinters are prone to starting many things and getting obsessed for a short time, before moving abruptly to something else. “Area people” excel at marathons. Send them on a long journey and they will doggedly keep at it for as long as it takes. The weakness of marathoners is that they often have trouble changing direction. When an opportunity opens up that requires quick, decisive action, marathoners might stubbornly maintain their current direction even when it no longer makes sense.",0.40385,0.24242,0.43596,0.12988,0.29765,0.43469,0.20108,0.32059,0.24679,0.41088,0.37317,0.34251,0.30534,0.12085,0.19061,0.31211,0.27617,0.23418,0.30372,0.10411,0.34265,0.16881,0.32889,0.16312,0.22161,0.21488,0.04403,0.1144,0.20064,0.21324,0.1947,0.25139,0.09429,0.08767,0.24239,0.21609,0.31992,0.35347,0.33442,0.28742,0.22041,0.1179,0.33305,0.17145,0.13258,0.03097,0.16245,0.10916,0.11709,0.18538,0.32861,0.21377,0.13661,0.20807,0.19212,0.2917,0.05457,0.11695,0.13408,0.08949,0.16664,0.2903,0.05909,0.11129,0.24237,0.12178,0.23887,0.12775,0.12476,0.17111,0.12784,0.1018,0.06826,0.13408,0.26262,0.12929,0.07352,0.00613,0.10152,-0.01246,0.06195,0.06831,0.05054,0.23121,0.23482,0.33445,0.22414,0.12991,0.17104,0.15793,0.16916,0.21165,0.28493,0.35673,0.22496,0.28908,0.09233,0.2762,0.26591,0.19535,0.2985,0.31411,0.25267,0.31568,0.20271,0.39358,0.47378,0.25398,0.35665,0.30064,0.48522,0.45219,0.16034,0.09486,0.22007,0.01909,0.10684,0.17501,0.3397,0.40597,1.0,0.28628,0.24591,0.10434,0.19526,0.3509,0.2868,0.32294,0.19775,0.35714,0.3709,0.3877,0.41473,0.36222,0.37733,0.31238,0.2253,0.35011,0.4199,0.32039,0.29186,0.17328,0.12178,0.08267,0.12532,0.07656,0.09734,0.05973,0.05014,0.07706,0.16779,0.13185,0.0311,0.10329,0.18552,0.1532,0.13683,0.18491,0.15074,0.19928,0.20953,0.15714,0.22067

This may be a strange thing to say in a book about organizing, but organizing by itself doesn’t add value. It has no inherent worth unless it puts you in a state of mind for taking effective action. This is why PARA is a minimalistic approach—it opts for little “nudges” to move items from one place to another as your needs change. It is a “bottom-up” method, responding to changes in your life organically. Instead of spending a lot of effort organizing your digital information “just in case” you need it someday, wait until your needs become crystal clear and then organize your notes and files “just in time” for the project you’re working on right now. This is how you avoid doing a lot of up-front work of questionable value, saving your energy for the moment when you know exactly what you’re trying to accomplish.",0.40902,0.43692,0.36533,0.24941,0.30651,0.47934,0.4961,0.48215,0.25493,0.40872,0.47764,0.50209,0.35771,0.18893,0.24754,0.38378,0.56373,0.37747,0.5096,0.133,0.39299,0.4097,0.4164,0.4154,0.42871,0.29016,0.17483,0.31782,0.1521,0.44511,0.33058,0.45243,0.11755,0.37884,0.49506,0.2161,0.33485,0.26994,0.24678,0.23006,0.24934,0.29308,0.23803,0.35818,0.24137,0.2327,0.26182,0.24271,0.33534,0.28337,0.57019,0.34833,0.29406,0.17004,0.54618,0.39686,0.10532,0.17693,0.22529,0.12815,0.20194,0.28116,0.02868,0.22687,0.17358,0.21723,0.17701,0.26177,0.27077,0.20954,0.2483,0.19025,0.21364,0.22529,0.25863,0.27124,0.20763,0.09151,0.11618,0.01738,0.14643,0.05739,0.14069,0.15868,0.43801,0.27476,0.14671,0.04119,0.16931,0.13383,0.18744,0.2081,0.36242,0.21599,0.15185,0.30486,0.03807,0.26169,0.21343,0.45923,0.18634,0.30459,0.25125,0.45191,0.49105,0.49745,0.38581,0.64589,0.69061,0.29119,0.34162,0.36077,0.35389,0.50629,0.52136,0.4162,0.49619,0.34626,0.24705,0.30473,0.36222,0.37036,0.39983,0.33416,0.36062,0.28717,0.31499,0.36584,0.27263,0.45511,0.44233,0.32453,0.85126,1.0,0.82678,0.3951,0.22932,0.42485,0.3744,0.6423,0.37728,0.39204,0.21723,0.14742,0.26656,0.25088,0.16827,0.13781,0.05024,0.15726,0.11377,0.21897,0.06671,0.13551,0.26817,0.18817,0.28349,0.24236,0.25673,0.27794,0.30899,0.20546,0.24036
590635937,31828755,"The PARA Method: Simplify, Organise and Master Your Digital Life",Tiago Forte,"HABIT 3: Keep Things Informal PARA requires precision in only one place: the definition of projects. Everything else is not only allowed to remain somewhat messy; that’s how it should be. Highly precise systems require a lot of effort to maintain, which means most aspects of your digital world should remain loose and informal by default. This rule recognizes that imposing order on information doesn’t always make it more valuable. You heard that right: sometimes organizing information too much makes it less valuable. The greatest breakthroughs often come from unexpected connections between ideas, and if your system is too rigidly formal, you’ll prevent such connections from ever forming. Allowing some messiness and randomness into the system creates opportunities for very different ideas to be connected and intermixed. This is why I don’t agree with a lot of the recommendations made by organizing gurus. For example, I don’t recommend: •  Creating an internal structure inside folders •  Using a standardized template for the contents of notes or documents •  Creating a hierarchy of subfolders within subfolders many levels deep •  Using databases or other formal methods for organizing personal information I’ve tried all these practices in the past, but always found that they took up valuable time that was much better suited to engaging with the ideas themselves.",0.31445,0.4353,0.29779,0.25923,0.25062,0.37236,0.52108,0.46089,0.22554,0.3259,0.38953,0.45114,0.33903,0.17667,0.17566,0.3473,0.50772,0.3849,0.43425,0.07691,0.34278,0.36948,0.29855,0.43335,0.38938,0.21892,0.15771,0.36085,0.11406,0.42537,0.29704,0.45105,0.1033,0.3992,0.46682,0.23418,0.31243,0.2073,0.17948,0.26778,0.20713,0.31755,0.15628,0.30482,0.16397,0.24749,0.2886,0.14984,0.33771,0.31593,0.57919,0.29193,0.33749,0.12185,0.59149,0.37947,0.09756,0.14177,0.16831,0.14005,0.24328,0.30295,0.1069,0.20297,0.17047,0.19518,0.19365,0.22352,0.2828,0.237,0.24719,0.17356,0.23799,0.16831,0.2522,0.28078,0.20606,0.13736,0.12758,0.04118,0.16996,0.06289,0.1969,0.15343,0.38361,0.22239,0.20869,0.05185,0.16568,0.11443,0.13128,0.13649,0.32921,0.22905,0.17253,0.28618,0.05317,0.21033,0.17743,0.35607,0.12449,0.23053,0.24724,0.33758,0.5304,0.56363,0.44523,0.61757,0.59212,0.2165,0.42575,0.4282,0.41681,0.4891,0.59444,0.44019,0.41142,0.33972,0.30879,0.35583,0.37733,0.41899,0.39847,0.22777,0.39065,0.38511,0.36745,0.44639,0.29408,0.42187,0.41771,0.22705,0.7188,0.82678,1.0,0.34002,0.19579,0.4353,0.3169,0.54565,0.26302,0.24015,0.19518,0.15895,0.23991,0.1537,0.13554,0.1577,0.01152,0.16043,0.11783,0.23319,0.05436,0.11725,0.26978,0.19303,0.29587,0.27409,0.28205,0.25788,0.24395,0.19394,0.22103
590635938,31828755,"The PARA Method: Simplify, Organise and Master Your Digital Life",Tiago Forte,How to Use PARA to Give You a Sense of Perspective It’s helpful to think of each main category of PARA as a “horizon.” Your projects exist on a short-term horizon that will play out in the coming hours or days. Your areas of responsibility and resources play out on a medium-term horizon over weeks and months. Your archives are more likely to be useful on a long-term horizon of months or years.,0.1813,0.1747,0.12265,0.10972,0.28067,0.15487,0.24907,0.30504,0.17194,0.32491,0.25999,0.27801,0.21336,0.0371,0.08419,0.16315,0.30583,0.16585,0.26983,0.13642,0.18156,0.076,0.19748,0.21969,0.16541,0.16763,0.08109,0.20192,0.10955,0.22824,0.25911,0.18685,0.178,0.22419,0.25623,0.09131,0.16525,0.15647,0.12471,0.15659,0.18417,0.17925,0.1692,0.18181,0.12343,0.13545,0.23768,0.13432,0.2381,0.24667,0.25713,0.24377,0.26787,0.10574,0.25824,0.26636,0.01454,0.11124,0.17295,0.07768,0.13026,0.15395,0.11678,0.0529,0.16371,0.14331,0.16938,0.09046,0.17131,0.20218,0.06946,0.16935,0.12852,0.17295,0.21652,0.18875,0.17534,0.09837,-0.00238,0.03844,0.08529,0.05026,0.06148,0.11884,0.25572,0.22395,0.09146,0.02519,0.17744,0.08241,0.1705,0.27018,0.18204,0.15421,0.12622,0.18197,0.04449,0.12372,0.13627,0.15627,0.17842,0.16295,0.18882,0.20199,0.12825,0.20041,0.51705,0.2947,0.31662,0.33146,0.35735,0.35662,0.18044,0.16164,0.27403,0.13196,0.26035,0.28185,0.34011,0.40921,0.31238,0.24843,0.28547,0.58201,0.1975,0.40192,0.34947,0.34241,0.28998,0.29483,0.30301,0.24565,0.58955,0.3951,0.34002,1.0,0.4343,0.45516,0.46429,0.12185,0.41343,0.61214,0.14331,0.12518,0.0966,0.05435,0.11706,0.08865,0.17884,0.15236,0.15243,0.17605,0.0678,0.13444,0.21058,0.14241,0.19422,0.1783,0.20001,0.11437,0.1967,0.15786,0.18716

You may not need to refer to them much during the workweek, when you’re just fighting fires. But occasionally, such as during a weekly review, it’s wise to elevate your perspective and think about the long term. This is when the content you’ve collected in your areas of responsibility and resources becomes valuable. At these times of deeper reflection, ask yourself these questions: •  What is the standard (of quality or performance) I’m committed to in each of my areas of responsibility? •  Am I currently meeting that standard? •  If not, are there any new projects, habits, routines, or other practices I can start, stop, or change? •  Are there any resources that would enable me to do so? When evaluating your resources, ask yourself questions like: •  Are there any new interests or passions I’d like to pursue more seriously? •  Are there any curiosities or questions I’d like to start exploring? •  Are there any hobbies or pursuits I’ve allowed to stagnate that I’d like to reboot?",0.32805,0.25354,0.23607,0.15709,0.21701,0.33597,0.24354,0.35487,0.17067,0.40578,0.35699,0.40424,0.29631,0.11545,0.23921,0.27294,0.34505,0.32375,0.34823,0.10183,0.3,0.16527,0.27441,0.31046,0.27615,0.25753,0.09014,0.21528,0.24758,0.16662,0.1934,0.2514,0.19406,0.22787,0.24034,0.23931,0.27604,0.25086,0.26717,0.19639,0.16928,0.21982,0.25603,0.24733,0.25121,0.14736,0.20087,0.11884,0.40098,0.31867,0.41037,0.18148,0.246,0.17758,0.39903,0.32,-0.00989,0.13191,0.1707,0.06298,0.12127,0.20485,0.04481,0.08465,0.15791,0.12768,0.14645,0.11069,0.11167,0.10496,0.11939,0.10301,0.04014,0.1707,0.20967,0.19503,0.10201,0.07474,0.05557,0.02286,0.07301,0.00636,0.01438,0.20755,0.22834,0.25179,0.1182,0.05705,0.14334,0.14491,0.2121,0.29417,0.29964,0.24288,0.19001,0.20575,0.06432,0.2138,0.17204,0.20311,0.20445,0.19836,0.22752,0.26911,0.10462,0.22137,0.54659,0.27581,0.363,0.34433,0.42642,0.33763,0.34489,0.21925,0.25179,0.12916,0.20515,0.39227,0.21659,0.54812,0.4199,0.37468,0.48379,0.10336,0.33012,0.29693,0.38343,0.33221,0.24053,0.43002,0.44604,0.46789,0.40775,0.3744,0.3169,0.46429,0.35085,0.59036,1.0,0.2116,0.3282,0.27548,0.12768,0.13581,0.08954,0.06756,0.12135,0.05043,0.03614,0.08852,0.08897,0.1392,0.04588,0.1356,0.19769,0.14895,0.1523,0.20455,0.17478,0.1532,0.30128,0.18156,0.16787

590635943,31828755,"The PARA Method: Simplify, Organise and Master Your Digital Life",Tiago Forte,"Power comes from the strength of your intellect. This is why I advise you to consume ideas from the world’s best thinkers and save the best ones you encounter in a centralized place that you can access anytime. Power comes from the force of your emotions. By surrounding yourself with information that provokes a feeling of fascination, you’ll begin to harness the incredible enthusiasm for learning and growth you have trapped inside.

There is no past, although there was a past. In our universe, there is no past, and no future, but only a present that is being calculated at every instant. This instantaneous nature of reality is deep because it helps us connect statistical physics with computation. The instantaneous universe of Prigogine implies that the past is unreachable because it is incomputable at the micro level.

The idea of crystallized imagination tells us that a country’s export structure carries information about more than just its abundance of capital and labor. A country’s export structure is a fingerprint that tells us about the ability of people in that country to create tangible instantiations of imaginary objects, such as automobiles, espresso machines, subway cars, and motorcycles, and of course about the myriad of specific factors that are needed to create these sophisticated products. In fact, the composition of a country’s exports informs us about the knowledge and knowhow that are embodied in that country’s population.3",0.1123,0.13316,0.16871,0.18818,0.25654,0.13536,0.09879,0.22379,0.13192,0.18302,0.16868,0.24935,0.15847,0.11101,0.06433,0.20648,0.29035,0.18311,0.21201,0.1582,0.27723,0.15085,0.19174,0.20149,0.13044,0.14064,0.18281,0.09389,0.1179,0.26131,0.28402,0.22193,0.19718,0.1309,0.31795,0.24716,0.37503,0.28735,0.2766,0.36323,0.22633,0.06965,0.10485,0.16404,0.05799,0.03405,0.19255,0.10939,0.25599,0.22844,0.09392,0.22995,0.01379,0.02494,-0.03321,0.37317,0.15365,0.15188,0.30914,0.07135,0.18448,0.27815,0.1503,0.10957,0.64927,0.20912,0.76955,0.1363,0.2728,0.22391,0.1582,0.34128,0.3835,0.30914,0.4879,0.47978,0.31405,0.07365,0.00566,0.0327,0.13154,0.16922,0.23121,0.27798,0.28198,0.34098,0.22931,0.23069,0.32833,0.22949,0.1898,0.28073,0.30898,0.28087,0.21159,0.33759,0.07788,0.07353,0.28412,0.0674,0.09346,0.1003,0.19548,0.12758,0.0202,0.08373,0.22278,0.13092,0.21659,0.1975,0.15691,0.09373,0.07751,0.05911,0.04515,-0.01129,0.00659,0.00724,0.09044,0.08398,0.16779,0.01836,0.19668,0.04848,0.22839,0.11616,0.05381,0.01139,0.01835,0.00105,0.05908,0.14035,0.15226,0.11377,0.11783,0.15243,0.14928,0.04119,0.08897,0.12304,0.18232,0.08247,0.20912,0.14342,0.08882,0.12107,0.16086,0.11245,0.08172,0.60454,1.0,0.56246,0.3065,0.41055,0.58445,0.5069,0.60176,0.50352,0.55808,0.42418,0.18586,0.24919,0.17758

In academic circles this humanly embodied knowledge is referred to as “tacit” knowledge when it involves knowhow that cannot be explicitly described.
