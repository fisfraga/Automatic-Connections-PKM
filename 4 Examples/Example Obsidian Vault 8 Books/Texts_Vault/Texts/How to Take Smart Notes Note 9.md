# How to Take Smart Notes Note 9




it is usually the best students who struggle the most. Good students wrestle with their sentences because they care about finding the  [[Rights|right]]  expression. It takes them longer to find a good  [[Idea]]  to write about because they know from  [[Experience]]  that the first  [[Idea]]  is rarely that great and good  [[Meaning of life|questions]]  do not fall into their laps. They spend more  [[Time]]  in the  [[Library]]  to get a better overview of the  [[Literature]] , which leads to more  [[Reading]] , which means that they have to juggle more  [[Information]] . Having  [[Reading|read]]  more does not automatically mean having more  [[Idea|ideas]] . Especially in the beginning, it means having fewer  [[Idea|ideas]]  to work with, because you know that  [[Other (philosophy)|others]]  have already thought of most of them.
