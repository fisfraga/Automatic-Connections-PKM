# The PARA Method Note 42




Power comes from the strength of your  [[Intelligence|intellect]] . This is why I advise you to consume  [[Idea|ideas]]  from the world’s best thinkers and save the best ones you encounter in a centralized place that you can access anytime. Power comes from the force of your emotions. By surrounding yourself with information that provokes a feeling of fascination, you’ll begin to harness the incredible enthusiasm for learning and growth you have trapped inside. Power comes from systems that don’t depend on your  [[Energy]]  levels, attention span, or  [[Discipline|self-discipline]] . That’s why PARA asks you to make one  [[Decision-making|decision]]  for each piece of  [[Information]] , and one  [[Decision-making|decision]]  only: When will this be relevant next? Finally, power comes from alignment.
