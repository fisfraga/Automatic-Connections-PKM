# How to Take Smart Notes Note 13




The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first  [[Idea]] . It is in the nature of writing, especially insight-oriented writing, that  [[Meaning of life|questions]]  change, the material we work with turns out to be very different from the  [[Neoplatonism|one]]  imagined or that new ideas emerge, which might change our  [[Holism|whole]]  perspective on what we do. Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned – which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work.
