# The PARA Method Note 14




never create an empty  [[Directory (computing)|folder]]  (or tag, or  [[Directory (computing)|directory]] , or other container) before you have something to put in it. Therefore, for your areas and resources, I recommend you hold off on creating any “speculative”  [[Directory (computing)|folders]]  until you’re sure what you want to put in them.
