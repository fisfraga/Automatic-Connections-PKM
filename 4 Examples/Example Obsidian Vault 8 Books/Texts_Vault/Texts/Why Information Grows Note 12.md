# Why Information Grows Note 12




We infuse messages with  [[Semantics|meaning]]  automatically, fooling ourselves to believe that the  [[Semantics|meaning]]  of a message is carried in the message. But it is not. This is only an  [[Illusion]] .  [[Semantics|Meaning]]  is derived from  [[Context (linguistics)|context]]  and prior  [[Knowledge]] .  [[Semantics|Meaning]]  is the  [[Hermeneutics|interpretation]]  that a  [[Knowledge]]  agent, such as a  [[Human]] , gives to a message, but it is different from the  [[Human body|physical]]  order that carries the message, and different from the message itself.  [[Semantics|Meaning]]  emerges when a message reaches a life-form or a machine with the  [[Skill|ability]]  to process  [[Information]] ;
