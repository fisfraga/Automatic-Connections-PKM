# Building a Second Brain Note 20




The most important factor in whether your notes can survive that journey into the future is their discoverability—how easy it is to discover what they contain and access the specific points that are most immediately useful. Discoverability is an idea from information science that refers to “the degree to which a piece of content or information can be found in a search of a file,  [[Database]] , or other information system.”I  [[Library|Librarians]]  think about discoverability when deciding how to lay out  [[Book|books]]  on the shelves. Web designers think about it when they create menus for the websites you visit every day.  [[Social media]]  platforms work hard to make the best content on their platforms as discoverable as possible.
