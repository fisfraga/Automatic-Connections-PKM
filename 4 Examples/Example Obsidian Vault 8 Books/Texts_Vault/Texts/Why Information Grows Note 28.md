# Why Information Grows Note 28




our planet is an out-of-equilibrium pocket inside a larger  [[System]] —the  [[Universe]] —that is moving toward equilibrium. In fact, our planet has never been close to any form of equilibrium. The  [[Energy]]  of the sun and the nuclear decay taking place in the Earth’s core drive our planet out of equilibrium, providing the  [[Energy]]  required for  [[Information]]  to emerge. We can think of our planet as a little whirlpool of  [[Information]]  in an otherwise vast and barren  [[Universe|cosmos]] .
