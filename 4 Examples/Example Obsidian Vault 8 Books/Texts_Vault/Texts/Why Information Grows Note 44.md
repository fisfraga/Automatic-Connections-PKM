# Why Information Grows Note 44




All evidence points to the  [[Fact]]  that our world is  [[Neoplatonism|one]]  in which  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow are “heavier” than the atoms we use to embody their  [[Pragmatism|practical]]  uses.  [[Information]]  can be moved around easily in the products that contain it, whether these are  [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] , books, or webpages, but  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow are trapped in the  [[Physical object|bodies]]  of people and the networks that these people form.  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow are so “heavy” that when it comes to a simple product such as a cellphone battery, it is infinitely easier to bring the lithium atoms that lie dormant in the Atacama Desert to Korea than to bring the knowledge of lithium batteries that resides in Korean scientists to the bodies of the miners who populate the Atacaman cities of Antofagasta and Calama.
