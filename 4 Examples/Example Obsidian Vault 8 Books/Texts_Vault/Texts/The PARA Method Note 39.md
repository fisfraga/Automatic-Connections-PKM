# The PARA Method Note 39




Day to day, in the trenches of  [[Getting Things Done]] , you want to focus only on your active projects. Projects include actions that need to be taken and information that needs to be reviewed in the next few hours or days. At this timescale, things are changing fast, so you should keep that information close at hand and at the center of your attention. These are the kinds of questions that are relevant on this short-term horizon: •  Which projects are most active right now? •  Which tasks are most time-sensitive? •  What are the next steps you need to take to move them forward? •  What information do you need access to in order to do so?
