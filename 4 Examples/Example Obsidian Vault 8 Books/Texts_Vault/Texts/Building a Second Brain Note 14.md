# Building a Second Brain Note 14




For modern, professional  [[Note-taking|notetaking]] , a note is a “knowledge building block”—a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head. By this definition, a note could include a passage from a book or article that you were inspired by; a photo or image from the  [[World Wide Web|web]]  with your annotations; or a bullet-point list of your meandering thoughts on a topic, among many other examples.
