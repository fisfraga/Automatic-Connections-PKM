# Building a Second Brain Note 29




There is a second shift that occurs when you begin to use your Second  [[Brain]]  not only for remembering, but for connecting and creating. You will transition from doing things primarily out of obligation or pressure to doing things from a spirit of service. I believe most  [[Person|people]]  have a  [[Nature|natural]]  desire within them to serve others. They want to teach, to mentor, to help, to contribute. The desire to give back is a  [[Basic research|fundamental]]  part of what makes us human.
