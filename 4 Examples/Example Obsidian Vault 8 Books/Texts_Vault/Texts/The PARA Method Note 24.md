# The PARA Method Note 24




Although you may feel a lot of enthusiasm for these pursuits, I recommend using the relatively cold word “resources” for a very specific  [[Reason]] . I am a naturally curious person with dozens, if not hundreds of different subjects I’d like to know more about. But I also know my tendency is to collect too much and become a “ [[Digital data|digital]]  hoarder.” I’ve found that I need a constraint to remind me what is worth saving and what isn’t. The word “resources” calls to mind the utility of a piece of information. Instead of asking, “Is this interesting?” which always results in overcollecting, I ask myself, “Is this useful?” That’s a much higher bar and forces me to consider what this piece of information will allow me to do
