# Why Information Grows Note 32




These  [[System|systems]]  tell us that  [[Computation]]  precedes the origins of life just as much as  [[Information]]  does. The chemical changes encoded by these  [[System|systems]]  are modifying the  [[Information]]  encoded in these chemical compounds, and therefore they represent a  [[Basic research|fundamental]]   [[Theory of forms|form]]  of  [[Computation]] . Life is a  [[Logical consequence|consequence]]  of the  [[Skill|ability]]  of  [[Matter]]  to compute.
