# How to Take Smart Notes Note 16




Learned  [[Ethics|right]] , which means  [[Understanding]] , which means connecting in a  [[Semantics|meaningful]]  way to previous  [[Knowledge]] ,  [[Information]]  almost cannot be forgotten anymore and will be reliably retrieved if triggered by the  [[Ethics|right]]  cues. Moreover, this new learned  [[Knowledge]]  can provide more possible connections for new  [[Information]] . If you focus your time and  [[Energy]]  on  [[Understanding]] , you cannot help but learn. But if you focus your time and  [[Energy]]  on  [[Learning]]  without trying to understand, you will not only not understand, but also probably not learn. And the  [[Causality|effects]]  are cumulative. There is a reason why the best scientists are also often very  [[Value (ethics and social sciences)|good]]  teachers. For someone like Richard Feynman,  [[Everything]]  was about  [[Understanding]] , regardless of whether he was doing  [[Research]]  or teaching.
