# Building a Second Brain Note 25




Making the shift to a  [[Mindset]]  of abundance is about letting go of the things we thought we needed to survive but that no longer serve us. It means giving up low- [[Value (ethics and social sciences)|value]]  work that gives us a false sense of security but that doesn’t call forth our highest selves. It’s about letting go of low- [[Value (ethics and social sciences)|value]]   [[Information]]  that seems important, but that doesn’t make us better  [[Person|people]] . It’s about putting down the protective shield of fear that tells us we need to protect ourselves from the opinions of  [[Other (philosophy)|others]] , because that same shield is keeping us from receiving the gifts they want to give us.
