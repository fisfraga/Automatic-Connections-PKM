# Why Information Grows Note 15




Humans are special animals when it comes to  [[Information]] , because unlike other  [[Species]] , we have developed an enormous ability to encode large volumes of  [[Information]]  outside our bodies. Naively, we can think of this information as the  [[Information]]  we encode in  [[Book|books]] , sheet music, audio recordings, and video. Yet for longer than we have been able to write we have been embodying  [[Information]]  in artifacts or objects, from arrows to microwave ovens, from stone axes to the physical  [[Internet]] . So our ability to produce chairs, computers, tablecloths, and wineglasses is a simple answer to the eternal question: what is the difference between us, humans, and all other  [[Species]] ? The answer is that we are able to create physical instantiations of the objects we imagine, while other  [[Species]]  are stuck with natureâ€™s inventory.
