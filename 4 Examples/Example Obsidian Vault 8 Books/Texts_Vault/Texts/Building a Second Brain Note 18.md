# Building a Second Brain Note 18




I’ve come to believe that  [[Personal knowledge management]]  is one of the most fundamental challenges—as well as one of the most incredible opportunities—in the world today. Everyone is in desperate need of a system to manage the ever-increasing volume of  [[Information]]  pouring into their  [[Intelligence|brains]] . I’ve heard the plea from students and executives, entrepreneurs and managers, engineers and writers, and so many others seeking a more  [[Productivity|productive]]  and empowered  [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]  with the information they consume. Those who learn how to leverage  [[Technology]]  and master the flow of information through their lives will be empowered to accomplish anything they set their minds to.
