# How to Take Smart Notes Note 12




What we can take from Allen as an important  [[Insight]]  is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the  [[Holism|holistic]]   [[Point of view (philosophy)|perspective]] . Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent. Even the best tools won’t make much of a difference if they are used in isolation. Only if they are embedded in a well-conceived working  [[Scientific method|process]]  can the tools play out their strengths. There is no point in having great tools if they don’t fit together.
