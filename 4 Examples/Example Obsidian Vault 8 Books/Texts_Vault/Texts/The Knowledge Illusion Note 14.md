# The Knowledge Illusion Note 14




Namely, the  [[Mind]]   [[Evolution|evolved]]  to support our ability to act effectively.  [[Thought|Thinking]]  beings were more likely to survive than their competitors because they were more likely to take  [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]  that benefited them in the short run and the long run. This has important implications for how we should understand the shape of  [[Thought]] . As  [[Intelligence|brains]]  get more  [[Complexity|complex]] , they get better at responding to deeper, more  [[Abstraction|abstract]]  cues from the environment, and this makes them ever more adaptive to new situations. This is critical to understanding the  [[Knowledge]]   [[Illusion]] : Storing details is often unnecessary to act effectively; a broad picture is generally all we need. Sometimes storing details is counterproductive, as in the case of hyperthymesics and Funes the Memorious. If we had evolved in an environment that favored other kinds of capacities rather than the ability to choose effective actions, the human mind would probably follow a different kind of logic than it does. If we evolved in a world that rewarded gambling on games of chance, we would probably be able to reason flawlessly about probability distributions and the laws of statistics. If we evolved in a world that rewarded deductive reasoning, we would probably all be like Spock, masterful at deducing conclusions. But most of us are miserable at both these things. Instead, we evolved in a world ruled by the logic of action, and that is why this kind of thought is so central to what makes us human. In the next chapter we will explain in more detail what the logic of action is and how it differs from other kinds of logic.
