# How to Take Smart Notes Note 11




The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended to do, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture. Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “ [[Mind]]  like water” - the state where we can focus on the work  [[Rights|right]]  in front of us without getting distracted by competing  [[Thought|thoughts]] . The  [[Principle]]  is simple but  [[Holism|holistic]] . It is not a quick fix or a fancy tool. It doesn’t do the work for you. But it does provide a structure for our everyday work that deals with the fact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds.
