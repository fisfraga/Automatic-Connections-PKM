# The Knowledge Illusion Note 10




Sharing  [[Skill|skills]]  and  [[Knowledge]]  is more sophisticated than it sounds.  [[Human|Human beings]]  don’t merely make  [[Individual]]  contributions to a  [[Project]] , like  [[Machine|machines]]  operating in an assembly line. Rather, we are able to work together, aware of others and what they are trying to accomplish. We pay attention together and we share  [[Goal|goals]] . In the language of  [[Cognitive science]] , we share intentionality. This is a form of collaboration that you don’t see in other animals. We actually enjoy sharing our  [[Mind]]   [[Space]]  with others. In one form, it’s called playing. Our skulls may delimit the frontier of our  [[Brain|brains]] , but they do not delimit the frontier of our  [[Knowledge]] . The  [[Mind]]  stretches beyond the  [[Brain]]  to include the  [[Human body|body]] , the  [[Natural environment|environment]] , and  [[Person|people]]  other than oneself, so the  [[Research|study]]  of the  [[Mind]]  cannot be reduced to the  [[Research|study]]  of the  [[Brain]] .  [[Cognitive science]]  is not the same as neuroscience.
