# The PARA Method Note 15




I recommend creating an additional, fifth folder alongside the four we’ve already covered, on each major platform you use (such as your Documents folder,  [[Cloud storage]]  drive, and  [[Note-taking|notetaking]]  app) with the title “Inbox.” The inbox is a temporary holding area where new items accumulate until you have time to put them in their proper place.8 In the next chapter I’ll explain how to do that.
