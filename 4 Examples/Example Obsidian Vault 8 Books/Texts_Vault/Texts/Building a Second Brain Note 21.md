# Building a Second Brain Note 21




This digital  [[Commonplace book]]  is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study  [[Notebook]] , a  [[Diary|personal journal]] , and a sketchbook for new ideas. It is a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your changing needs over time. In school or courses you take, it can be used to take notes for studying. At work, it can help you organize your projects. At home, it can help you manage your household. However you decide to use it, your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single  [[Use case]] . It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solitude before sharing it with others.
