# Building a Second Brain Note 37




Information isn’t a luxury—it is the very basis of our survival. Just as with the food we put into our bodies, it is our responsibility and right to choose our information diet. It’s up to us to decide what information is good for us, what we want more of and less of, and ultimately, what we do with it. You are what you consume, and that applies just as much to information as to nutrition. A Second Brain gives us a way to filter the  [[Information]]  stream and curate only the very best  [[Idea|ideas]]  we encounter in a private, trusted place. Think of it as planting your own “ [[Knowledge]]  garden” where you are free to cultivate your  [[Idea|ideas]]  and develop your own  [[Thought|thinking]]  away from the deafening noise of other people’s opinions.
