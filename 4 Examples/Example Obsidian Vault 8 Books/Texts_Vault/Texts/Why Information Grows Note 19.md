# Why Information Grows Note 19




The car’s dollar value evaporated in the crash not because the crash destroyed the atoms that made up the  [[Bugatti]]  but because the crash changed the way in which these were arranged. As the parts that made the  [[Bugatti]]  were pulled apart and twisted, the information that was embodied in the  [[Bugatti]]  was largely destroyed. This is another way of saying that the $2.5 million worth of value was stored not in the car’s atoms but in the way those atoms were arranged.3 That arrangement is information.4
