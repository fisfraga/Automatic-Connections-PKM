# Building a Second Brain Note 24




The opposite of a Scarcity Mindset is an Abundance  [[Mindset]] . This is a  [[Tao|way]]  of looking at the  [[World]]  as full of valuable and helpful things— [[Idea|ideas]] ,  [[Insight|insights]] , tools, collaborations, opportunities. An Abundance  [[Mindset]]  tells us that there is an endless amount of incredibly powerful  [[Knowledge]]  everywhere we look—in the content we consume, in our  [[Social network]] , in our bodies and  [[Intuition|intuitions]] , and in our own minds. It also tells us that we don’t need to consume or understand all of it, or even much of it. All we need is a few seeds of wisdom, and the seeds we most need tend to continually find us again and again. You don’t need to go out and hunt down insights. All you have to do is listen to what life is repeatedly trying to tell you. Life tends to surface exactly what we need to know, whether we like it or not.
