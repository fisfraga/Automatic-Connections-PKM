# The Knowledge Illusion Note 3




Nobody could be a master of every facet of even a single thing. Even the simplest  [[Physical object|objects]]  require complex webs of  [[Knowledge]]  to manufacture and use. We haven’t even mentioned really complicated things that arise in nature such as bacteria, trees, hurricanes, love, and the  [[Scientific method|process]]  of reproduction. How do those  [[Work (human activity)|work]] ? Most people can’t tell you how a  [[Coffeemaker]]  works, how glue holds paper together, or how the focus works on a camera, let alone something as complex as love. Our point is not that people are ignorant. It’s that people are more ignorant than they think they are. We all suffer, to a greater or lesser extent, from an  [[Illusion]]  of  [[Understanding]] , an  [[Illusion]]  that we  [[Understanding|understand]]  how things work when in  [[Fact]]  our  [[Understanding]]  is meager.
