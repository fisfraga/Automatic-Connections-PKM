# How to Take Smart Notes Note 8




Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ  [[Self-control|willpower]] . This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended  [[Scientific method|process]]  like  [[Scientific method|research]] ,  [[Thought|thinking]]  or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new  [[Insight]] ,  [[Understanding]]  or achievement – which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception. Even though planning is often at odds with the very idea of research and learning, it is the  [[Mantra]]  of most study guides and self-help books on academic writing. How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated? It is a huge  [[Understanding|misunderstanding]]  that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery – or insight.
