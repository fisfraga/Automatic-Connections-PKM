A project (or program) is any undertaking, carried out individually or collaboratively and possibly involving research or design, that is carefully planned (usually by a project team, but sometimes by a project manager or by a project planner) to achieve a particular aim. An alternative view sees a project managerially as a sequence of events: a "set of interrelated tasks to be executed over a fixed period and within certain cost and other limitations". A project may form a part of wider programme managementor function as an ad hoc system.
