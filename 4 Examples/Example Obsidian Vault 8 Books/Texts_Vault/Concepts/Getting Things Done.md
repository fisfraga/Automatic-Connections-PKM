# Getting Things Done


Getting Things Done (GTD) is a personal productivity system developed by David Allen and published in a book of the same name. GTD is described as a time management system. Allen states "there is an inverse relationship between things on your mind and those things getting done". First published in 2001, a revised edition of the book was released in 2015 to reflect the changes in information technology during the preceding decade.
