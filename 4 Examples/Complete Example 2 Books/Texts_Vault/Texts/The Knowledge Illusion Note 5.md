[[Thought|Thinking]]   [[Evolution|evolved]]  as an extension of the  [[Skill|ability]]  to act effectively; it evolved to make us better at doing whatâ€™s necessary to achieve our  [[Goal|goals]] .  [[Thought]]  allows us to select from among a  [[Set (mathematics)|set]]  of possible actions by predicting the  [[Causality|effects]]  of each  [[Action (philosophy)|action]]  and by imagining how the  [[World]]  would be if we had taken different actions in the  [[Past]] .
