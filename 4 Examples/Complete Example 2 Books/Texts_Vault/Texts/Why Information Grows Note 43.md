# Why Information Grows Note 43




As we discussed previously, complex products embody and amplify the  [[Pragmatism|practical]]  uses of knowledge and knowhow. Hence, the people making these products need to have access to the knowledge and knowhow required to make them in their “raw”  [[Theory of forms|form]] —that is, the knowledge and knowhow embodied in human flesh, not the  [[Pragmatism|practical]]  uses of knowledge and knowhow embodied implicitly in items. In academic circles this humanly  [[Tacit knowledge|embodied knowledge]]  is referred to as “ [[Tacit knowledge|tacit” knowledge]]  when it involves knowhow that cannot be explicitly described. As the Hungarian polymath Michael Polanyi cleverly noted, often “we know more than we can tell.”3
