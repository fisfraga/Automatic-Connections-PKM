# Why Information Grows Note 11




 [[Information]]  is incorporeal, but it is always physically embodied.  [[Information]]  is not a  [[Object (philosophy)|thing]] ; rather, it is the arrangement of physical things. It is physical order, like what distinguishes different shuffles of a deck of cards. What is surprising to most  [[Person|people]] , however, is that  [[Information]]  is meaningless, even though the meaningless  [[Nature]]  of  [[Information]] , much like its physicality, is often misunderstood.
