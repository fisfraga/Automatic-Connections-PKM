# Why Information Grows Note 41




Without this  [[Nature|physical]]  embodiment the  [[Pragmatism|practical]]  uses of  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow cannot be transmitted. Crystallizing  [[Imagination]]  is therefore  [[Essence|essential]]  for sharing the  [[Pragmatism|practical]]  uses of the  [[Knowledge]]  that we accumulate in our  [[Mind]] . Without our  [[Skill|ability]]  to crystallize  [[Imagination]] , the  [[Pragmatism|practical]]  uses of  [[Knowledge]]  would not exist, because that  [[Pragmatism|practicality]]  does not reside solely in the  [[Idea]]  but hinges on the tangibility of the implementation. Once again, the physicality of products—whether tangible or digital—augments us. And it is through this augmentation that products help us communicate something that words cannot: the  [[Pragmatism|practical]]  uses of knowhow,  [[Imagination]] , and  [[Knowledge]] .
