Instead, we are buying access to the  [[Pragmatism|practical]]  uses of the  [[Creativity]]  of the  [[Human|person]]  who invented toothpaste, the scientific knowledge informing the chemical synthesis that is required to make toothpaste, the knowhow required to synthesize sodium fluoride, put it inside a tube, and make it available across the planet, and the knowledge that fluoride makes our teeth stronger and has beneficial  [[Causality|effects]]  on our health.
