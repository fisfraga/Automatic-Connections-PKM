# The Knowledge Illusion Note 4




We can’t possibly understand everything, and the sane among us don’t even try. We rely on  [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]]  knowledge, vague and unanalyzed. We’ve all seen the exceptions—people who cherish detail and love to talk about it at great length, sometimes in fascinating ways. And we all have domains in which we are experts, in which we know a lot in exquisite detail. But on most subjects, we connect only  [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]]  bits of information, and what we know is little more than a feeling of  [[Understanding]]  we can’t really unpack. In  [[Fact]] , most knowledge is little more than a bunch of associations, high-level links between  [[Object (philosophy)|objects]]  or people that aren’t broken down into detailed stories. So why don’t we realize the depth of our ignorance? Why do we think we  [[Understanding|understand]]  things deeply, that we have systematic webs of  [[Knowledge]]  that make  [[Sense]]  of  [[Everything]] , when the  [[Reality]]  is so different? Why do we live in an  [[Illusion]]  of  [[Understanding]] ?
