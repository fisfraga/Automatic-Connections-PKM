# The Knowledge Illusion Note 12




What is  [[Truth|true]]  of face perception is  [[Truth|true]]  of all perception. Being smart is all about having the  [[Skill|ability]]  to extract deeper, more  [[Abstraction|abstract]]   [[Information]]  from the flood of  [[Data]]  that comes into our  [[Sense|senses]] . Instead of just reacting to the light, sounds, and smells that surround them, animals with sophisticated large  [[Intelligence|brains]]  respond to deep,  [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]]  properties of the world that they are  [[Sense|sensing]] . This allows them to detect extraordinarily subtle and complex similarities and differences in new situations that allow them to act effectively, even in situations they’ve never encountered before. The  [[Reason]]  that deeper, more  [[Abstraction|abstract]]   [[Information]]  is helpful is that it can be used to pick out what we’re interested in from an incredibly complex array of possibilities, regardless of how the focus of our interest presents itself. We make use of  [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]]  information to, for example, recognize familiar melodies. Once you’ve heard Brahms’s Lullaby, you can recognize it no matter what key it’s played in or what instrument it’s played on, even if it’s played with several errors. Whatever it is that allows us to recognize a familiar tune, it is not a  [[Memory]]  of the specific event of hearing that tune in the past. It must be something quite  [[Abstraction|abstract]] . We rely on this  [[Abstraction|abstract]]   [[Information]]  to recognize stuff all the time, and we’re not even aware that we’re doing so.
