That physical order is information. Iris’ nighttime delivery was facilitated not by objects, but by the information embodied in these objects and by the practical uses of knowledge and knowhow that these objects implicitly carry. Her nighttime delivery was illuminated not just by light bulbs but by the understanding of electricity, energy, and materials embodied in those light bulbs. Iris was kept warm that night not by a random collection of threads but by blankets that wove together matter, knowledge, and imagination. Paradoxically, Iris was born into a nonfictional world that, although tangible, is made of fiction.

583516125,31385202,The Knowledge Illusion: The myth of individual thought and the power of collective wisdom,Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach,"What is true of face perception is true of all perception. Being smart is all about having the ability to extract deeper, more abstract information from the flood of data that comes into our senses. Instead of just reacting to the light, sounds, and smells that surround them, animals with sophisticated large brains respond to deep, abstract properties of the world that they are sensing. This allows them to detect extraordinarily subtle and complex similarities and differences in new situations that allow them to act effectively, even in situations they’ve never encountered before. The reason that deeper, more abstract information is helpful is that it can be used to pick out what we’re interested in from an incredibly complex array of possibilities, regardless of how the focus of our interest presents itself. We make use of abstract information to, for example, recognize familiar melodies. Once you’ve heard Brahms’s Lullaby, you can recognize it no matter what key it’s played in or what instrument it’s played on, even if it’s played with several errors. Whatever it is that allows us to recognize a familiar tune, it is not a memory of the specific event of hearing that tune in the past. It must be something quite abstract.

583516127,31385202,The Knowledge Illusion: The myth of individual thought and the power of collective wisdom,Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach,"Namely, the mind evolved to support our ability to act effectively. Thinking beings were more likely to survive than their competitors because they were more likely to take actions that benefited them in the short run and the long run. This has important implications for how we should understand the shape of thought. As brains get more complex, they get better at responding to deeper, more abstract cues from the environment, and this makes them ever more adaptive to new situations. This is critical to understanding the knowledge illusion: Storing details is often unnecessary to act effectively; a broad picture is generally all we need. Sometimes storing details is counterproductive, as in the case of hyperthymesics and Funes the Memorious. If we had evolved in an environment that favored other kinds of capacities rather than the ability to choose effective actions, the human mind would probably follow a different kind of logic than it does. If we evolved in a world that rewarded gambling on games of chance, we would probably be able to reason flawlessly about probability distributions and the laws of statistics. If we evolved in a world that rewarded deductive reasoning, we would probably all be like Spock, masterful at deducing conclusions. But most of us are miserable at both these things. Instead, we evolved in a world ruled by the logic of action, and that is why this kind of thought is so central to what makes us human. In the next chapter we will explain in more detail what the logic of action is and how it differs from other kinds of logic.",0.46702,0.26284,0.48161,0.22686,0.35828,0.3321,0.49312,0.41181,0.39043,0.41168,0.38219,0.43456,0.36866,0.3846,0.47431,0.46702,0.48163,0.37653,0.30953,0.20554,0.16495,0.19147,0.30501,0.36932,0.42299,0.28068,0.49592,0.52412,0.35323,0.52912,0.70392,0.67323,0.48227,0.43244,0.54895,0.50989,0.50326,0.36257,0.48184,1.0,0.41181,0.3334,0.33642,0.30318,0.3264,0.38391,0.25427,0.37442,0.28412,0.36989,0.14635,0.27918,0.38672,0.37009,0.38998,0.39172,0.38589,0.39601,0.31787,0.50393,0.42244
