The difference between the world where Iris was born and the world of early hominids resides not in the physicality of matter but in the way in which matter is arranged. That physical order is information. Iris’ nighttime delivery was facilitated not by objects, but by the information embodied in these objects and by the practical uses of knowledge and knowhow that these objects implicitly carry. Her nighttime delivery was illuminated not just by light bulbs but by the understanding of electricity, energy, and materials embodied in those light bulbs. Iris was kept warm that night not by a random collection of threads but by blankets that wove together matter, knowledge, and imagination.

Naively, we can think of this information as the information we encode in books, sheet music, audio recordings, and video. Yet for longer than we have been able to write we have been embodying information in artifacts or objects, from arrows to microwave ovens, from stone axes to the physical Internet. So our ability to produce chairs, computers, tablecloths, and wineglasses is a simple answer to the eternal question: what is the difference between us, humans, and all other species?

From this fundamental perspective we will describe the economy as the system by which people accumulate knowledge and knowhow to create packets of physical order, or products, that augment our capacity to accumulate more knowledge and knowhow and, in turn, accumulate more information. We will focus largely on the growth of information, knowledge, and knowhow in the economy by first creating a theory of products in terms of physical order and then explaining the social and economic mechanisms that enable our society to accumulate the knowledge and knowhow we need to produce products.",547332530

547332533,28486441,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",Cesar Hidalgo,"It is worth noting that entropy, even though commonly associated with disorder, is not exactly a measure of disorder. Entropy measures the multiplicity of a state (the number of states that are equivalent). It so happens, however, that disordered states tend to have high multiplicity, so in practice high-entropy states are extremely likely to be disordered. That is why equating disorder with entropy is not such a bad simplification. Yet entropy can increase without increasing disorder.",547332533

To function, individuals rely not only on knowledge stored within our skulls but also on knowledge stored elsewhere: in our bodies, in the environment, and especially in other people.

Most people can’t tell you how a coffeemaker works, how glue holds paper together, or how the focus works on a camera, let alone something as complex as love.

We rely on abstract knowledge, vague and unanalyzed. We’ve all seen the exceptions—people who cherish detail and love to talk about it at great length, sometimes in fascinating ways. And we all have domains in which we are experts, in which we know a lot in exquisite detail. But on most subjects, we connect only abstract bits of information, and what we know is little more than a feeling of understanding we can’t really unpack. In fact, most knowledge is little more than a bunch of associations, high-level links between objects or people that aren’t broken down into detailed stories. So why don’t we realize the depth of our ignorance? Why do we think we understand things deeply, that we have systematic webs of knowledge that make sense of everything, when the reality is so different?

583516118,31385202,The Knowledge Illusion: The myth of individual thought and the power of collective wisdom,Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach,Thought is for action. Thinking evolved as an extension of the ability to act effectively; it evolved to make us better at doing what’s necessary to achieve our goals.

It is in the things we make, in our bodies and workspaces, and in other people. We live in a community of knowledge. We have access to huge amounts of knowledge that sit in other people’s heads: We have our friends and family who each have their little domains of expertise. We have experts that we can contact to, say, fix our dishwasher when it breaks down for the umpteenth time. We have professors and talking heads on television to inform us about events and how things work. We have books, and we have the richest source of information of all time at our fingertips, the Internet.",583516121
583516122,31385202,The Knowledge Illusion: The myth of individual thought and the power of collective wisdom,Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach,"There has always been what cognitive scientists like to call a division of cognitive labor. From the beginning of civilization, people have developed distinctive expertise within their group, clan, or society. They have become the local expert on agriculture, medicine, manufacturing, navigating, music, storytelling, cooking, hunting, fighting, or one of many other specialties. One individual may have some expertise in more than one skill, perhaps several, but never all, and never in every aspect of any one thing. No chef can cook all dishes. Though some are mighty impressive, no musician can play every instrument or every type of music. No one has ever been able to do everything. So we collaborate. That’s a major benefit of living in social groups, to make it easy to share our skills and knowledge. It’s not surprising that we fail to identify what’s in our heads versus what’s in others’, because we’re generally—perhaps always—doing things that involve both.",583516122

Human beings don’t merely make individual contributions to a project, like machines operating in an assembly line. Rather, we are able to work together, aware of others and what they are trying to accomplish. We pay attention together and we share goals. In the language of cognitive science, we share intentionality. This is a form of collaboration that you don’t see in other animals. We actually enjoy sharing our mind space with others. In one form, it’s called playing. Our skulls may delimit the frontier of our brains, but they do not delimit the frontier of our knowledge. The mind stretches beyond the brain to include the body, the environment, and people other than oneself, so the study of the mind cannot be reduced to the study of the brain. Cognitive science is not the same as neuroscience.",583516123

As the Internet becomes ever more integrated into our lives, the community of knowledge has never been richer, as vast, or as easily accessible. There are other implications too. Because we think communally, we tend to operate in teams. This means that the contributions we make as individuals depend more on our ability to work with others than on our individual mental horsepower. Individual intelligence is overrated. It also means that we learn best when we’re thinking with others.",583516124
583516125,31385202,The Knowledge Illusion: The myth of individual thought and the power of collective wisdom,Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach,"What is true of face perception is true of all perception. Being smart is all about having the ability to extract deeper, more abstract information from the flood of data that comes into our senses. Instead of just reacting to the light, sounds, and smells that surround them, animals with sophisticated large brains respond to deep, abstract properties of the world that they are sensing. This allows them to detect extraordinarily subtle and complex similarities and differences in new situations that allow them to act effectively, even in situations they’ve never encountered before. The reason that deeper, more abstract information is helpful is that it can be used to pick out what we’re interested in from an incredibly complex array of possibilities, regardless of how the focus of our interest presents itself. We make use of abstract information to, for example, recognize familiar melodies. Once you’ve heard Brahms’s Lullaby, you can recognize it no matter what key it’s played in or what instrument it’s played on, even if it’s played with several errors. Whatever it is that allows us to recognize a familiar tune, it is not a memory of the specific event of hearing that tune in the past. It must be something quite abstract. We rely on this abstract information to recognize stuff all the time, and we’re not even aware that we’re doing so.",583516125
583516126,31385202,The Knowledge Illusion: The myth of individual thought and the power of collective wisdom,Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach,The reason most of us are not hyperthymesics is because it would make us less successful at what we evolved to do. The mind is busy trying to choose actions by picking out the most useful stuff and leaving the rest behind. Remembering everything gets in the way of focusing on the deeper principles that allow us to recognize how a new situation resembles past situations and what kinds of actions will be effective.,583516126
583516127,31385202,The Knowledge Illusion: The myth of individual thought and the power of collective wisdom,Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach,"Namely, the mind evolved to support our ability to act effectively. Thinking beings were more likely to survive than their competitors because they were more likely to take actions that benefited them in the short run and the long run. This has important implications for how we should understand the shape of thought. As brains get more complex, they get better at responding to deeper, more abstract cues from the environment, and this makes them ever more adaptive to new situations. This is critical to understanding the knowledge illusion: Storing details is often unnecessary to act effectively; a broad picture is generally all we need. Sometimes storing details is counterproductive, as in the case of hyperthymesics and Funes the Memorious. If we had evolved in an environment that favored other kinds of capacities rather than the ability to choose effective actions, the human mind would probably follow a different kind of logic than it does. If we evolved in a world that rewarded gambling on games of chance, we would probably be able to reason flawlessly about probability distributions and the laws of statistics. If we evolved in a world that rewarded deductive reasoning, we would probably all be like Spock, masterful at deducing conclusions. But most of us are miserable at both these things. Instead, we evolved in a world ruled by the logic of action, and that is why this kind of thought is so central to what makes us human. In the next chapter we will explain in more detail what the logic of action is and how it differs from other kinds of logic.",583516127

This instantaneous nature of reality is deep because it helps us connect statistical physics with computation. The instantaneous universe of Prigogine implies that the past is unreachable because it is incomputable at the micro level.

A country’s export structure is a fingerprint that tells us about the ability of people in that country to create tangible instantiations of imaginary objects, such as automobiles, espresso machines, subway cars, and motorcycles, and of course about the myriad of specific factors that are needed to create these sophisticated products.

This is an interpretation of the economy as a knowledge and knowhow amplifier, or a knowledge and knowhow amplification engine: a complex sociotechnical system able to produce physical packages containing the information needed to augment the humans who participate in it.1 Ultimately, the economy is the collective system by which humans make information grow.",591548160
591548161,28486441,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",Cesar Hidalgo,"As we discussed previously, complex products embody and amplify the practical uses of knowledge and knowhow. Hence, the people making these products need to have access to the knowledge and knowhow required to make them in their “raw” form—that is, the knowledge and knowhow embodied in human flesh, not the practical uses of knowledge and knowhow embodied implicitly in items. In academic circles this humanly embodied knowledge is referred to as “tacit” knowledge when it involves knowhow that cannot be explicitly described. As the Hungarian polymath Michael Polanyi cleverly noted, often “we know more than we can tell.”3",591548161
591548162,28486441,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",Cesar Hidalgo,"All evidence points to the fact that our world is one in which knowledge and knowhow are “heavier” than the atoms we use to embody their practical uses. Information can be moved around easily in the products that contain it, whether these are objects, books, or webpages, but knowledge and knowhow are trapped in the bodies of people and the networks that these people form. Knowledge and knowhow are so “heavy” that when it comes to a simple product such as a cellphone battery, it is infinitely easier to bring the lithium atoms that lie dormant in the Atacama Desert to Korea than to bring the knowledge of lithium batteries that resides in Korean scientists to the bodies of the miners who populate the Atacaman cities of Antofagasta and Calama.",591548162
591548163,28486441,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",Cesar Hidalgo,"At the individual level, accumulating knowledge is difficult because learning is experiential. That is, we accumulate knowledge and knowhow mostly through practice, such as on-the-job experience.",591548163
591548164,28486441,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",Cesar Hidalgo,"Knowhow, in particular, resides primarily in humans’ nervous systems.",591548164
591548165,28486441,"Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies",Cesar Hidalgo,"Getting knowledge inside a human’s nervous system is not easy because learning is both experiential and social.5 To say that learning is social means that people learn from people: children learn from their parents and employees learn from their coworkers (I hope). The social nature of learning makes the accumulation of knowledge and knowhow geographically biased. People learn from people,",591548165
