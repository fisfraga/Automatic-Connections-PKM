# The PARA Method Note 16




TIP 3: Use a Naming Convention It’s helpful if you can see a folder—on any platform, on any device—and instantly know which of the four main PARA categories it is in. I like to use an informal naming convention to make this possible, such as: •  Emojis at the beginning of titles for project folders •  Capitalized titles for area folders •  Uncapitalized titles for resource folders
