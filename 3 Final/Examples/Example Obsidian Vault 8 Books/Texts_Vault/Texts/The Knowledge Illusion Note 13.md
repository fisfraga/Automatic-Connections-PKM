# The Knowledge Illusion Note 13




The  [[Reason]]  most of us are not hyperthymesics is because it would make us less successful at what we evolved to do. The  [[Mind]]  is busy trying to choose  [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]  by picking out the most useful stuff and leaving the rest behind. Remembering  [[Everything]]  gets in the way of focusing on the deeper  [[Principle|principles]]  that allow us to recognize how a new situation resembles past situations and what kinds of  [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]  will be effective.
