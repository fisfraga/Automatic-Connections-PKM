# Building a Second Brain Note 28




Tags are like small labels you can apply to certain notes regardless of where they are located. Once they are tagged, you can perform a search and see all those notes together in one place. The main weakness of folders is that  [[Idea|ideas]]  can get siloed from each other, making it hard to spark interesting connections. Tags can overcome this limitation by infusing your Second  [[Brain]]  with connections, making it easier to see cross-disciplinary themes and  [[Pattern|patterns]]  that defy simple  [[Categorization]] .
