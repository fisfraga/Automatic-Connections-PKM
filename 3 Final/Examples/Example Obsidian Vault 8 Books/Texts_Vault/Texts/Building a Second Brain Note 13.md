# Building a Second Brain Note 13




Robert Darnton explains the role of  [[Commonplace book|commonplace books]] : Unlike modern  [[Reading|readers]] , who follow the flow of a narrative from beginning to end, early modern Englishmen  [[Reading|read]]  in fits and starts and jumped from book to  [[Book]] . They broke texts into fragments and assembled them into new patterns by transcribing them in different sections of their notebooks. Then they reread the copies and rearranged the patterns while adding more excerpts. Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality.III  [[Commonplace book|Commonplace books]]  were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of  [[Knowledge]]  from different sources and to inspire their own  [[Thought|thinking]] .
