# Why Information Grows Note 35




Thinking of product exports in terms of crystallized  [[Imagination]]  tells us that we live in a world in which some  [[Nation|countries]]  are net importers of  [[Imagination]] , while others are net exporters of it. The  [[Idea]]  of crystallized  [[Imagination]]  tells us that a country’s export structure carries  [[Information]]  about more than just its abundance of capital and  [[Labour economics|labor]] . A country’s export structure is a fingerprint that tells us about the  [[Skill|ability]]  of  [[Person|people]]  in that country to create tangible instantiations of imaginary objects, such as automobiles, espresso  [[Machine|machines]] , subway cars, and motorcycles, and of course about the myriad of specific factors that are needed to create these sophisticated products. In fact, the composition of a country’s exports informs us about the knowledge and knowhow that are embodied in that country’s population.3
