# How to Take Smart Notes Note 6




We know today that  [[Self-control]]  and  [[Discipline|self-discipline]]  have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed. Nobody needs  [[Self-control|willpower]]  not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs  [[Self-control|willpower]]  to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. Having a  [[Semantics|meaningful]]  and well-defined task beats  [[Self-control|willpower]]  every time. Not having  [[Self-control|willpower]] , but not having to use  [[Self-control|willpower]]  indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of  [[Writing]]  and  [[Note-taking]]  comes into  [[Play (activity)|play]] .
