# Why Information Grows Note 14




The delivery room where Iris made her journey was full of tangible  [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] , but those  [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] , per se, were not what made the world she found modern. The difference between the  [[World]]  where Iris was born and the  [[World]]  of early hominids resides not in the physicality of  [[Matter]]  but in the  [[Tao|way]]  in which  [[Matter]]  is arranged. That  [[Human body|physical]]  order is  [[Information]] . Irisâ€™ nighttime delivery was facilitated not by  [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] , but by the  [[Information]]  embodied in these  [[Object (philosophy)|objects]]  and by the  [[Pragmatism|practical]]  uses of  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow that these  [[Physical object|objects]]  implicitly carry. Her nighttime delivery was illuminated not just by light bulbs but by the  [[Understanding]]  of electricity,  [[Energy]] , and materials embodied in those light bulbs. Iris was kept warm that night not by a  [[Randomness|random]]  collection of threads but by blankets that wove together  [[Matter]] ,  [[Knowledge]] , and  [[Imagination]] . Paradoxically, Iris was born into a nonfictional world that, although tangible, is made of fiction. This world is different from the one in which our  [[Species]]   [[Evolution|evolved]]  only in the way in which  [[Matter]]  is arranged.
