# The PARA Method Note 17




STEP 1: Retitle New Items in Your Inbox In a typical week, I accumulate around ten to twenty new  [[Digital data|digital]]  items in my inbox. They might include notes from a team meeting, highlights from a book I’m reading, a useful screenshot from a website, or a voice memo I recorded about a new idea, for example. When they are initially created, these kinds of files normally have a useless title like “Untitled document” or “New note.” I find that it aids future retrieval tremendously if I take a few seconds to look at each item I’ve saved and change its title or name to something more informative and clear.
