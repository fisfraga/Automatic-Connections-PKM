# Building a Second Brain Note 17




VI. Recent advancements and discoveries in the field of “ [[Extended mind thesis|extended cognition]] ” have shed new light on how  [[Pragmatism|practical]]  and powerful it can be to “think outside the  [[Brain]] .” This book isn’t focused on the  [[Science]] , but for an excellent introduction to  [[Extended mind thesis|extended cognition]]  I recommend The  [[Extended mind thesis|Extended Mind]]  by Annie Murphy Paul. VII. Vannevar Bush wrote of a “scholar’s workstation” called a “Memex,” which was “a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and  [[Communication|communications]] , and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his  [[Memory]] .”
