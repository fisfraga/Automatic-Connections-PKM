# The PARA Method Note 40




Areas and resources become relevant on a longer time horizon, stretching from weeks to months. You may not need to refer to them much during the workweek, when you’re just fighting fires. But occasionally, such as during a weekly review, it’s wise to elevate your perspective and think about the long term. This is when the content you’ve collected in your areas of responsibility and resources becomes valuable. At these times of deeper reflection, ask yourself these questions: •  What is the standard (of quality or performance) I’m committed to in each of my areas of responsibility? •  Am I currently meeting that standard? •  If not, are there any new projects, habits, routines, or other practices I can start, stop, or change? •  Are there any resources that would enable me to do so? When evaluating your resources, ask yourself questions like: •  Are there any new interests or passions I’d like to pursue more seriously? •  Are there any curiosities or questions I’d like to start exploring? •  Are there any hobbies or pursuits I’ve allowed to stagnate that I’d like to reboot?
