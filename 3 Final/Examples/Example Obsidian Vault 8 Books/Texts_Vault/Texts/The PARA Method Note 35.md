# The PARA Method Note 35




HABIT 2: Organize Just in Time My organizing  [[Philosophy]]  is to organize as little as possible, as late as possible, and only as much as absolutely needed. This may be a strange thing to say in a book about organizing, but organizing by itself doesn’t add value. It has no inherent worth unless it puts you in a state of mind for taking effective action. This is why PARA is a minimalistic approach—it opts for little “nudges” to move items from one place to another as your needs change. It is a “bottom-up” method, responding to changes in your life organically. Instead of spending a lot of effort organizing your  [[Digital data|digital]]  information “just in case” you need it someday, wait until your needs become crystal clear and then organize your notes and files “just in time” for the project you’re working on right now. This is how you avoid doing a lot of up-front work of questionable value, saving your  [[Energy]]  for the moment when you know exactly what you’re trying to accomplish.
