# The PARA Method Note 19




STEP 3: Update Your Active Projects Finally, take a look at your project folders and make changes to reflect what’s happened over the past week. This could include actions such as: •  Changing the name of a project to reflect a new scope or direction •  Splitting a large project into smaller ones to make it more achievable •  Archiving a project that has been completed, put on hold, canceled, or handed over to someone else •  Unarchiving a dormant project that has since become active again and moving it back to the Projects folder
