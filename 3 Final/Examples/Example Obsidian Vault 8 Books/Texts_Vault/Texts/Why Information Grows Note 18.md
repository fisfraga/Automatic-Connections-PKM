# Why Information Grows Note 18




So the central actors that I will use to describe the growth of information in our planet include  [[Physical object|physical objects]] , as the physical embodiment of information, and  [[Person|people]] , as the  [[Basic research|fundamental]]  embodiment of  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow. From this  [[Basic research|fundamental]]   [[Point of view (philosophy)|perspective]]  we will describe the  [[Economic system|economy]]  as the  [[System]]  by which  [[Person|people]]  accumulate  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow to create packets of  [[Nature|physical]]  order, or products, that augment our capacity to accumulate more  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow and, in turn, accumulate more information. We will focus largely on the growth of information,  [[Knowledge]] , and knowhow in the  [[Economy]]  by first creating a  [[Theory]]  of products in terms of  [[Nature|physical]]  order and then explaining the social and  [[Economy|economic]]  mechanisms that enable our  [[Society]]  to accumulate the  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow we need to produce products.
