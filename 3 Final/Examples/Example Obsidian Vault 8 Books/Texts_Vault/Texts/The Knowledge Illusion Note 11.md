# The Knowledge Illusion Note 11




The  [[Knowledge]]   [[Illusion]]  also affects how we should think about the most transformative  [[Technology]]  of our age, the Internet. As the  [[Internet]]  becomes ever more integrated into our lives, the community of  [[Knowledge]]  has never been richer, as vast, or as easily accessible. There are other implications too. Because we think communally, we tend to operate in teams. This means that the contributions we make as individuals depend more on our ability to work with others than on our  [[Individual]]   [[Mind|mental]]  horsepower.  [[Individual]]   [[Intelligence]]  is overrated. It also means that we learn best when weâ€™ [[Religious education|re]]   [[Thought|thinking]]  with others.
