# The Knowledge Illusion Note 2




The  [[Mind|human mind]]  is not like a desktop computer, designed to hold reams of  [[Information]] . The mind is a flexible  [[Problem solving|problem solver]]  that evolved to extract only the most useful  [[Information]]  to guide  [[Decision-making|decisions]]  in new situations. As a  [[Logical consequence|consequence]] , individuals store very little detailed  [[Information]]  about the  [[World]]  in their heads. In that  [[Sense]] , people are like bees and  [[Society]]  a beehive: Our  [[Intelligence]]  resides not in  [[Individual]]   [[Intelligence|brains]]  but in the collective mind. To function, individuals rely not only on  [[Knowledge]]  stored within our skulls but also on  [[Knowledge]]  stored elsewhere: in our  [[Physical object|bodies]] , in the  [[Natural environment|environment]] , and especially in other people. When you put it all together,  [[Human]]   [[Thought]]  is incredibly impressive. But it is a product of a community, not of any individual alone.
