# Building a Second Brain Note 27




The second way that  [[Person|people]]  use their Second  [[Brain]]  is to connect  [[Idea|ideas]]  together. Their Second  [[Brain]]   [[Evolution|evolves]]  from being primarily a  [[Memory]]   [[Tool]]  to becoming a  [[Thought|thinking]]   [[Tool]] . A piece of advice from a mentor comes in handy as they encounter a similar situation on a different team. An illuminating  [[Metaphor]]  from a book finds its way into a presentation they’ [[Religious education|re]]  delivering. The  [[Idea|ideas]]  they’ve captured begin gravitating toward each other and cross-pollinating.
