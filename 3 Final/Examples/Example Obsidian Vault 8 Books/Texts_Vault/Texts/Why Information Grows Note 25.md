# Why Information Grows Note 25




The  [[Correlation|correlations]]  that characterize the  [[Information]]  we transmit through  [[Human]]   [[Theory of forms|forms]]  of  [[Communication]]  (such as English) or biological  [[Theory of forms|forms]]  of  [[Communication|communications]]  (such as  [[DNA]] ) are there whether we know how to decode them or not. They are a characteristic of  [[Information]] -rich states, not of who is observing them. This tells us that when it comes to  [[Communication]] , the  [[Semantics|meaningful]]  rides on the meaningless. Our ability to transmit  [[Semantics|meaningful]]  messages builds on the prior existence of meaningless  [[Theory of forms|forms]]  of  [[Physics|physical]]  order. These meaningless  [[Theory of forms|forms]]  of order are what  [[Information]]  truly is.*
