# Building a Second Brain Note 12




We have to recognize that the  [[Cognition|cognitive]]  demands of modern life increase every year, but weâ€™re still using the same brains as two hundred thousand years ago, when  [[Human|modern humans]]  first emerged on the plains of East Africa. Every bit of  [[Energy]]  we spend straining to recall things is  [[Energy]]  not spent doing the  [[Thought|thinking]]  that only  [[Human|humans]]  can do: inventing new things, crafting stories, recognizing  [[Pattern|patterns]] , following our  [[Intuition]] , collaborating with others, investigating new subjects, making plans, testing  [[Theory|theories]] . Every minute we spend trying to mentally juggle all the stuff we have to do leaves less  [[Time]]  for more meaningful pursuits like cooking, self-care, hobbies, resting, and spending  [[Time]]  with loved ones.
