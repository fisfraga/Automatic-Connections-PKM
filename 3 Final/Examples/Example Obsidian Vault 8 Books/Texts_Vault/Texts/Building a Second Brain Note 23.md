# Building a Second Brain Note 23




“We only know what we make.” To truly “know” something, it’s not enough to read about it in a book.  [[Idea|Ideas]]  are merely  [[Thought|thoughts]]  until you put them into  [[Action (philosophy)|action]] .  [[Thought|Thoughts]]  are fleeting, quickly fading as time passes. To truly make an  [[Idea]]  stick, you have to engage with it. You have to get your hands dirty and apply that  [[Knowledge]]  to a  [[Pragmatism|practical]]   [[Problem solving|problem]] . We learn by making  [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]]  things—before we feel ready, before we have it completely figured out, and before we know where it’s going. It is when you begin expressing your  [[Idea|ideas]]  and turning your  [[Knowledge]]  into  [[Action (philosophy)|action]]  that  [[Life]]  really begins to change.
