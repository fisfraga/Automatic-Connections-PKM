# World Wide Web


The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, was originally a hypertext document management system accessed over the Internet. It has since evolved into the world's dominant software platform. The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
