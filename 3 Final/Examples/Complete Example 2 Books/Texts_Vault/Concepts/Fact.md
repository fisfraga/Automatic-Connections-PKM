# Fact


A fact is something that is true. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiabilityâ€”that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means.
