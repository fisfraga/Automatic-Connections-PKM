# Why Information Grows Note 39




We also should consider the expressive  [[System|component]]  in the creation of products (even though this expressive  [[System|component]]  is, ironically, repressed in many  [[Person|people]] ). We also crystallize  [[Imagination]]  because this allows us to transform our  [[Idea|ideas]]  into a sharable  [[Reality]] . It is not only through consumption that we satisfy our hedonism. We want  [[Other (philosophy)|others]]  to like us, to want us, and to feel the way we do. We want  [[Other (philosophy)|others]]  to know what it feels like to see the world from our  [[Point of view (philosophy)|perspective]] . Reembodying our  [[Thought|thoughts]]  into  [[Object (philosophy)|objects]]  is a great way of achieving exactly that, as anyone who takes the word inspiration seriously has found. Crystallizing our  [[Thought|thoughts]]  into tangible and digital  [[Object (philosophy)|objects]]  is what allows us to share our  [[Thought|thoughts]]  with  [[Other (philosophy)|others]] . Otherwise, our  [[Thought|thoughts]]  are trapped in the prison of our minds.
