# Why Information Grows Note 33




For Prigogine, the  [[Past]]  is not just unreachable; it simply does not exist. There is no past, although there was a  [[Past]] . In  [[Universe|our universe]] , there is no  [[Past]] , and no future, but only a present that is being calculated at every instant. This instantaneous nature of reality is deep because it helps us connect statistical  [[Physics]]  with computation. The instantaneous  [[Universe]]  of Prigogine implies that the past is unreachable because it is incomputable at the micro level. Prigogineâ€™s  [[Entropy]]  barrier forbids the present to evolve into the past, except in idealized  [[System|systems]] , like a pendulum or planetary orbits, which look the same going forward and backward (when there is no dissipation involved).
