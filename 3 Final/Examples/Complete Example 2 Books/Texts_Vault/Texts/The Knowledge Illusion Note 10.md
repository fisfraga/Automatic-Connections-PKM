# The Knowledge Illusion Note 10




Sharing  [[Skill|skills]]  and  [[Knowledge]]  is more sophisticated than it sounds.  [[Human|Human beings]]  don’t merely make  [[Individual]]  contributions to a project, like  [[Machine|machines]]  operating in an assembly line. Rather, we are able to work together, aware of others and what they are trying to accomplish. We pay attention together and we share  [[Goal|goals]] . In the language of  [[Cognitive science]] , we share intentionality. This is a form of collaboration that you don’t see in other animals. We actually enjoy sharing our  [[Mind]]   [[Space]]  with others. In one form, it’s called playing. Our skulls may delimit the frontier of our brains, but they do not delimit the frontier of our  [[Knowledge]] . The  [[Mind]]  stretches beyond the brain to include the  [[Human body|body]] , the  [[Natural environment|environment]] , and  [[Person|people]]  other than oneself, so the study of the  [[Mind]]  cannot be reduced to the study of the brain.  [[Cognitive science]]  is not the same as neuroscience.
