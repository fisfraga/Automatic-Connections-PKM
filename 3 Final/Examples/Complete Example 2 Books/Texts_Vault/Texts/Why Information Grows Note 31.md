# Why Information Grows Note 31




So by combining the ideas of Prigogine and Schr√∂dinger, we can understand where  [[Information]]  comes from (the  [[Steady state]]  of non-equilibrium systems) and why it sticks around (because it is stored in  [[Solid|solids]] ). The poetic oddity of this combination is that it tells us that  [[Universe|our universe]]  is both frozen and dynamic.
