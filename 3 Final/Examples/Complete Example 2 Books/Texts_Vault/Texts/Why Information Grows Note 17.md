# Why Information Grows Note 17




The case of  [[Society]]  and economies is the  [[Neoplatonism|one]]  that is most  [[Complexity|complex]] , as here the  [[Capital accumulation|accumulation]]  of  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow becomes highly constrained. Much like  [[Information]] , which is embodied in  [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] ,  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow always need to be physically embodied. Yet unlike  [[Information]] ,  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow are embodied in humans and networks of  [[Human|humans]]  that have a finite capacity to embody  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow. The finiteness of  [[Human|humans]]  and of the networks we  [[Theory of forms|form]]  limits our ability to accumulate and transmit  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow, leading to  [[Space|spatial]]  accumulations of  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow that result in global inequality.
