# Why Information Grows Note 13




To battle disorder and allow information to grow, our  [[Universe]]  has a few tricks up its sleeve. These tricks involve out-of- [[Homeostasis|equilibrium]]   [[System|systems]] , the accumulation of information in solids, and the ability of  [[Matter]]  to compute. Together these three mechanisms contribute to the growth of information in small islands or pockets where information can grow and hide, like our body or our planet.
