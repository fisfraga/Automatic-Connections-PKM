# Why Information Grows Note 34




 [[Thought|Thinking]]  about products as crystals of  [[Imagination]]  tells us that products do not just embody  [[Information]]  but also  [[Imagination]] . This is  [[Information]]  that we have generated through  [[Mind|mental]]   [[Computation|computations]]  and then disembodied by creating an  [[Object (philosophy)|object]]  that mimics the  [[Neoplatonism|one]]  we had in our head.
