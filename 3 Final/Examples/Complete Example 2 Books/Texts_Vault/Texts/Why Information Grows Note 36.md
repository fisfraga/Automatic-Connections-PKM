# Why Information Grows Note 36




Thinking about products as crystals of  [[Imagination]]  helps us understand the importance of the source of the  [[Information]]  that is embodied in a product.  [[Complexity|Complex]]  products are not just arrangements of  [[Atom|atoms]]  that perform functions; rather, they are ordered arrangements of  [[Atom|atoms]]  that originated as  [[Imagination]] . In some cases, this metaphor is quite literal.
