# Why Information Grows Note 42




It helps us see the  [[Economy]]  not as the careful management of resources, the  [[Wealth]]  of a nation, or a  [[Social network|network]]  of financial transactions, but as a  [[System]]  that amplifies the  [[Pragmatism|practical]]  uses of  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow through the  [[Nature|physical]]  embodiment of  [[Information]]  and the  [[Context (linguistics)|context]] -specific properties that this  [[Information]]  helps carry. This is an  [[Hermeneutics|interpretation]]  of the  [[Economic system|economy]]  as a  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow amplifier, or a  [[Knowledge]]  and knowhow amplification engine: a  [[Complexity|complex]]  sociotechnical system able to produce  [[Nature|physical]]  packages containing the  [[Information]]  needed to augment the  [[Human|humans]]  who participate in it.1 Ultimately, the  [[Economic system|economy]]  is the  [[Social organization|collective]]  system by which  [[Human|humans]]  make  [[Information]]  grow.
