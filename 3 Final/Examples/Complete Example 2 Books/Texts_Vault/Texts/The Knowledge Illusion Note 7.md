# The Knowledge Illusion Note 7




If you’re like most people and you’re not interested in investigating the insides of a  [[Coffeemaker|coffee machine]] , then you know even less detail about how it works. Your  [[Causality|causal]]   [[Understanding]]  is limited to only what you need to know: how to make the  [[Object (philosophy)|thing]]  work (with any luck you’ve mastered that). The  [[Mind]]  is not built to acquire details about every individual  [[Object (philosophy)|object]]  or situation. We learn from  [[Experience]]  so that we can generalize to new  [[Object (philosophy)|objects]]  and situations. The ability to act in a new  [[Context (linguistics)|context]]  requires understanding only the deep regularities in the way the world works, not the superficial details.
